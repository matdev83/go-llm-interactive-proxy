# Development iteration performance

The development loop must stay scoped and reuse Go's native caches. Comprehensive
certification remains a separate, deliberate delivery step. This policy covers
tests, builds, linting, cache lifecycle, and the automated cost watchdog.

## Use during development

```sh
make dev-test PKGS='./internal/core/routing/...'
make dev-build PKGS='./cmd/lipstd'
make dev-lint PKGS='./internal/core/routing/...'
make dev-test MODULE=connectors/openrouter PKGS='./...' DEV_REPEAT=2
make dev-doctor
```

`PKGS` is required for test/build/lint. There is no silent fallback to the full
repository. Patterns are relative to `MODULE`, which defaults to the root module.
`DEV_JOBS` defaults to 4; tune it for the actual machine and keep it stable during
comparisons. `DEV_REPEAT=2` runs the identical operation twice and prints elapsed
time. Tests report passed/cached/failed/skipped package counts. Child-process or
telemetry errors fail the command. `dev-lint` requires golangci-lint and does not
substitute a weaker analyzer or silently skip missing tooling.

These commands do not infer reverse dependencies, certify other modules, or run
tagged integration/architecture tiers. Include affected consumers while iterating
on shared contracts. Before delivery, use the applicable `make test`, `make qa`,
module-local, parity, persistence, race, and platform gates from `AGENTS.md`.
`test-fast` retains its complete root-graph contract; it is not package selection.

Keep `GOCACHE`, `GOMODCACHE`, and the lint cache in stable, writable locations
outside disposable worktrees. Do not clear them as routine troubleshooting. Do
not routinely add `-a`, `-count=1`, race, coverage, or alternating build tags.
For final regression proof, intentionally run focused fresh tests, for example
`go test -count=1 ./path/to/package`. Build cache reuse still applies to that run.
Local `dev-build` omits VCS stamping to avoid linking again solely after a commit;
release commands retain their existing VCS/trimpath policy.

For unexplained misses, compare identical scoped runs first. `make dev-doctor`
prints the effective Go version, flags, cache paths, CPU budget, linter version,
and lint cache status. It checks that Go caches are writable. When the Go cache is
disabled so even the diagnostic cannot compile, start with `go env GOCACHE`.
Use `GODEBUG=gocachetest=1 go test ./path/to/package` for result-cache miss reasons
and `go build -x ./path/to/package` to distinguish compilation from linking.
Record exact commands, OS, toolchain, scope, and cold/warm state with measurements.

## Why earlier improvements stopped being sufficient

Audited against `main` at `b1e81926`; source history, not prior claims alone:

| Earlier work | What remains in the current tree |
| --- | --- |
| #218 | Shared staging fixtures, helper builds, isolated store tests, cheaper timeout tests |
| #231 | Shared architecture `go list` query cache |
| #291/#293 | Deduplicated compilation/vet/archtest; complete cached root test path |
| #294/#296/#297 | Dedicated CI cache restore/save actions; setup-go caching disabled in those jobs |
| #417 | Per-test-process connector/helper build reuse and AST loading singleflight |
| #449 | Core-count test parallelism, bounded module/fuzz/parity pools, cheaper default precommit |
| #558 | Windows-authoritative CPU/process/I/O/wall/package cost ratchet |
| #665 | Fast file-backed SQLite test DSNs, concurrent architecture plan, test-quick |

The inspected mechanisms have not been wholesale reverted. This does not prove
that every historical test optimization survived unchanged, or that a specific
developer's cache was configured correctly. The local Windows environment was not
available for direct inspection.

| Revision | Go source files | Test files | Go modules |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| #218 (`49c379aa`) | 3,603 | 1,846 | 19 |
| #293 (`c08260f2`) | 4,023 | 2,096 | 19 |
| #449 (`f936b8f1`) | 4,958 | 2,642 | 22 |
| #665 (`d196469b`) | 6,316 | 3,517 | 42 |
| Audited main (`b1e81926`) | 6,366 | 3,552 | 42 |

Counts include tracked Go files across independent modules, excluding agent-skill
examples. Growth increases cold compile/analyzer cost and the scope invalidated by
shared-package changes. The report in `docs/test-suite-performance.md` also records
~56 seconds of link/startup work on its Windows machine and overlapping tagged
passes. Native caches do not eliminate arbitrary subprocess/test setup work.

Three concrete infrastructure defects were present:

1. Dedicated CI snapshots still used dependency-only immutable keys. An exact
   key hit prevented saving new source build progress until dependencies changed.
   CI test and database parity jobs also shared one namespace; parity never saved
   its own accumulated cache. New snapshots include OS, architecture, actual Go
   version, job, dependency fingerprint, and source revision. Restore prefixes
   prefer the same dependency fingerprint, then the same toolchain/job. Each
   lane saves its own progress; caches still obey GitHub's branch/ref isolation.
2. The lint module pool defaulted to CPU count, while each golangci-lint process
   also used parallel analyzers. Both scripts now default to two module workers
   and two analyzer workers each. Override with `LIP_LINT_JOBS` and
   `LIP_LINT_CONCURRENCY`; defaults are a contention bound, not a claim of optimal
   throughput on every machine.
3. The QA cross-platform selector test mutated one Git checkout from parallel
   subtests, and its untracked selector disappeared after checkout. Both failures
   reproduced on unchanged main. Cases now run serially and the selector belongs
   to the base fixture commit; assertions are unchanged.

The live public cache inventory contained 16 entries totaling ~10.55 GB during
this investigation. Fresh snapshots alone would worsen storage pressure. The
trusted default-branch retention workflow removes superseded Go snapshots, keeps
the newest per workflow family/OS/architecture/job/ref, retires legacy keys only
after a replacement exists in that ref, and removes recognized closed-PR Go
caches. Unknown keys and unrelated caches are untouched. The selector is tested
offline; deletion is isolated in a workflow with `actions: write` and never runs
PR code or consumes PR artifacts. Cleanup also runs periodically. This bounds
obsolete accumulation, but cannot guarantee that the repository's configured
capacity fits all simultaneously active lanes and PRs.

## Regression prevention

- QA guards require source-advancing, toolchain/job-isolated cache keys, matching
  restore/save lanes, bounded lint scheduling, and discoverable scoped commands.
- `Development cost watchdog` runs the existing Windows-authoritative cost
  ratchet weekly and on manual dispatch, retaining measurements and failure logs.
  Ordinary production changes previously did not trigger that ratchet automatically.
  No budget, anchor, exception, or coverage threshold is loosened by this change.
- Retention prevents the source-refresh fix from accumulating unbounded obsolete
  snapshots. GitHub's capacity and cache eviction still need to be considered
  when active parallel workloads exceed the minimum retained footprint.
- Agent instructions specify focused checks during edits and comprehensive
  evidence after coherent changes. Avoid duplicating equivalent gates after each
  edit or treating a cached successful check as evidence after a new mutation.

The existing cost anchor predates #665's speedup and contains permissive legacy
store-package allowances. Recalibrating it against a clean Windows measurement is
a follow-up; changing those numbers without measurement would create false
assurance. The watchdog provides recurring evidence instead of waiting for a
developer to notice a slowdown.

## Validation measurements

On this Linux container (Go 1.26.6, effective 8 CPU budget, pinned linter v2.12.2),
with writable shared caches and no forced cache invalidation:

| Operation | First measured call | Identical repeat |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Scoped devcheck package tests | 0.147 s | 0.048 s, result cached |
| Warm local `cmd/lipstd` development build | 0.197 s | 0.195 s |
| Scoped lint of devcheck + QA | 4.464 s | 0.337 s |

The initially cold root command build took 53.098 seconds. These are cache-state
observations, not before/after Windows speedup claims. CLI bootstrap adds a small
Go-run overhead outside the printed child elapsed time. A sandbox/root full-suite
attempt was unsuitable for certification: sockets were blocked and the host
security policy rejects administrative execution. Verification uses a disposable
non-root checkout with normal subprocess access instead. No Windows-authoritative
cost improvement or remote cache hit-rate improvement is claimed from these local
measurements; the new workflows must provide that evidence after landing.
