# OpenAI Codex backend

The `openai-codex` backend connects to the ChatGPT Codex Responses API (`https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses`). Route selectors use the `openai-codex` prefix, for example `openai-codex:gpt-5.5`.

## Enable

```yaml
plugins:
  backends:
    - id: codex
      kind: openai-codex
      enabled: true
      config:
        access_token: ""   # or api_key
        account_id: ""     # optional ChatGPT account header
```

## Credentials

This connector is single-user only. The standard distribution rejects it when `access.mode: multi_user` is enabled because its credentials are private user OAuth/ChatGPT material whether supplied through explicit tokens, `auth_json_path`, default Codex CLI discovery, or managed OAuth account files.

- YAML: `access_token` (preferred) or `api_key`, plus optional `api_keys` / `credentials`.
- Environment: `OPENAI_CODEX_ACCESS_TOKEN`, then numbered `_2`, `_3`, …; falls back to `OPENAI_CODEX_API_KEY` (+ `_N` variants) when access-token vars are unset.
- When neither `access_token` nor `auth_json_path` is set, the connector reads `~/.codex/auth.json` if present (Codex CLI default).

## Token file permissions

On Unix, the `auth.json` file and managed-OAuth account files in `managed_oauth_storage_path` must be owner-only (`0600`). Files readable or writable by group or other are rejected at load time with an error mentioning `group/other accessible`; fix with `chmod 600 <file>`. This mirrors the Codex CLI `auth.json` guard and fails closed on multi-user hosts. On Windows (ACL-based permissions, no meaningful Unix mode bits) this check is a no-op.

Symlinked account files inside the managed-OAuth storage directory are skipped during discovery, so a symlink planted in that directory cannot cause the proxy to read a target outside it. Use real files for managed accounts.

Without `models`, the connector advertises the auto-discovered Codex model
catalog. At startup the proxy runs `codex debug models` and parses the routable
model slugs (and per-model reasoning-effort settings); on any failure (or when
`codex_model_catalog.enabled: false`) it falls back to a shipped embedded
snapshot (`internal/core/codexcatalog/codex_model_catalog.json`). No model slugs
are hardcoded in the connector. See the top-level `codex_model_catalog` config
section to disable discovery, override the fallback path, or pin the codex
binary. The Codex app-server backend additionally advertises the `auto` routing
sentinel (the app-server resolves the actual model server-side).

> Backward-incompatible: legacy Codex slugs the CLI no longer advertises (e.g.
> `gpt-5.3-codex`, `gpt-5.1-codex`, `gpt-oss-120b`) are no longer in the
> built-in inventory. To keep them, ship a custom fallback JSON (same `codex
> debug models` format) and set `codex_model_catalog.fallback_path`.

## Transport

The default transport is HTTPS/SSE. WebSocket support is experimental and only enabled when `experimental_websocket: true` is set. With that opt-in, `transport: auto` tries `wss://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses` first and falls back to HTTPS/SSE only if WebSocket fails before the first canonical event. After that first event, stream errors are surfaced and not retried. Use `transport: websocket` to fail instead of falling back during debugging. After a pre-output WebSocket failure, auto mode skips WebSocket for `websocket_fallback_cooldown_seconds` to avoid repeated retry latency.

## Client compatibility (OpenCode / Pi / Droid / Hermes)

OpenCode, Pi, Factory Droid, and Hermes Agent bridge prompts are **not** applied by the backend adapter. Enable the opt-in feature plugin instead:

```yaml
plugins:
  features:
    - id: codex-client-compat
      enabled: true
      config: {}
```

The request-part hook detects client markers from extensions, headers, prompts, and tool names, then mutates the canonical call for selected `openai-codex` backend attempts before backend translation. It no-ops for other backends. For Hermes-marked calls it also sets the `openai_codex.tool_strict=false` extension, which makes the Codex payload emit Responses tools with `strict=false` and defaults `parallel_tool_calls` to `true` when unset.

## Routing example

```yaml
routes:
  default: "openai-codex:gpt-5.5"
```

Bracket parameters such as `?reasoning_effort=high&verbosity=low` are supported in route selectors.

## Per-request routing

A client can override the configured default route per request by putting a full route
selector in the request body `model` field, with optional URI parameters:

```json
{ "model": "openai-codex:gpt-5.5?reasoning_effort=low&verbosity=high", "input": "ping" }
```

The `openai-codex:` prefix selects the backend, the model name selects any model (the
built-in inventory comes from the auto-discovered `codex debug models` catalog;
arbitrary model strings can still be routed even if not listed), and the `reasoning_effort`
URI parameter is converted into the canonical call options and then into the Codex payload
`reasoning.effort` field. An explicit `X-LIP-Route` header, when present, takes precedence
over the body `model`. A bare model name without a backend prefix still falls back to the
configured default route.

URI parameters are explicit routing directives and **override** any corresponding value
set elsewhere: `?reasoning_effort=xhigh&verbosity=high` wins over matching request-body
values and over `default_reasoning_effort`/`default_verbosity`. A parameter absent from the
selector leaves the other value in effect. The Codex HTTP payload emits verbosity as
`text.verbosity`.

## Unsupported generation parameters

The Codex Responses API does not support `temperature`, `top_p`, or `max_output_tokens`.
Plain calls that set any of these fail at payload-build time with an explicit error.
The `openai_codex.ignore_unsupported_gen_params` canonical-call extension (bool, `true`)
opts in to dropping them instead — the `codex-client-compat` feature sets this for
detected compatibility clients (OpenCode, pi, Factory Droid, Hermes) so optional tuning
params are not forwarded upstream and do not fail the request. `reasoning_effort` and
`parallel_tool_calls` are honored.

## Model name normalization

Clients that use a `provider/model` namespace (for example OpenCode's `openai/gpt-5.4-mini`)
have the leading `openai/` prefix stripped before the model reaches the Codex upstream, which
rejects org-prefixed model names. A bare model name such as `gpt-5.4-mini` is sent unchanged.

## System messages

The Codex Responses API rejects `system`-role items in `input` ("System messages are not
allowed"). System content must be carried in the `instructions` field. The connector folds
system-role messages from the conversation into `instructions` (deduplicated against explicit
instructions, including the `codex-client-compat` bridge) and omits them from `input`, so
clients that send a system prompt (for example OpenCode) interoperate without a capability
mismatch.

## Tool schemas

The Codex Responses API requires function-tool parameter schemas to be
"strict-compatible" when sent with `strict:true`: every object must declare
`additionalProperties:false` and list all of its properties in `required`.
Clients that emit looser schemas (for example OpenCode's `apply_patch`, which
omits `additionalProperties`) would otherwise be rejected with
`invalid_function_parameters`. The connector inspects each tool schema and
sends `strict:false` for any schema that is not strict-compatible, while
keeping `strict:true` for strict-compatible and parameterless schemas. This is
a safe relaxation — it only disables strict validation and never causes an
upstream rejection. The Hermes compatibility bridge keeps its existing
`tool_strict:false` behavior (all tools relaxed).

## Tool call history

When a client sends a prior assistant tool call and its result back (for example
OpenCode following up after executing a tool), the Chat Completions frontend
encodes the assistant tool call as a `PartJSON` item in the Chat Completions
shape (`type:"function"` with a nested `function:{name,arguments}` object and
`id` as the call id). The connector translates that into a Codex Responses
`function_call` input item (using the Chat Completions `id` as the `call_id`)
and the matching `tool`-role result into a `function_call_output` item with the
same `call_id`, so the upstream sees a correctly linked call/output pair. The
`codex-client-compat` bridge recognizes Chat Completions-style tool calls when
matching tool results, so results that belong to a known call are preserved
rather than treated as orphaned.
