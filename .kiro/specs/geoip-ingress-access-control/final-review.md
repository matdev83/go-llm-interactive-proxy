## Final Scope Statement

The spec defines one optional **early standard-HTTP data-plane GeoIP ingress gate** with:

1. enforceably immutable generation-scoped policy/resolver configuration;
2. process-scoped local Country MMDB/LKG/updater service;
3. exact `deny_allow` / `allow_deny` class precedence;
4. IPv4/IPv6 exact-address and CIDR rules;
5. direct peer by default and trusted XFF/RFC `Forwarded` resolution only behind explicit trusted-proxy prefixes;
6. aggregate handling of repeated authoritative forwarding-header fields under fixed abuse bounds;
7. local request-path MMDB lookup with no remote per-request service;
8. source-specific local/managed database startup behavior;
9. managed automatic MaxMind updates with explicit response-reader ownership, crash-durable version publication, deterministic restart recovery, and shutdown serialization;
10. pure policy hot reload through existing immutable generations;
11. generic early 403 denial with dedicated bounded observability;
12. explicit management-plane, `check-config`, and in-flight-generation compatibility.

## Requirements Completeness Review

**Decision: PASS**

The 15 requirements cover:

- exact early middleware placement and disabled wrapper omission;
- Apache-compatible order truth table;
- IPv4/IPv6 and mapped-address normalization;
- country field/no-country semantics;
- direct peer and trusted-proxy forwarding security;
- local MMDB lookup contract;
- process readiness/LKG/warm provisioning;
- managed updates and Windows-safe version lifecycle;
- reload/restart field classification;
- generic denial/info-disclosure behavior;
- bounded metrics/log-spam prevention;
- hard resource/security/performance gates;
- management/data-plane and generation-pinning compatibility;
- network-free `check-config` and operator documentation.

The design now gives Requirement 13's "hard bounds" concrete v1 values: 16 KiB aggregate selected forwarding-header bytes, 32 hops, 128 MiB managed download, 2-minute managed operation timeout, and a managed interval default/range of 24h / 6h-168h with ±10% jitter.

The original issue's cache intent remains satisfied without mandating an attacker-keyed per-IP cache: one long-lived local MMDB reader eliminates per-request backend/opening work, while any future cache must be bounded and benchmark-justified.

## Brownfield Gap Review

**Decision: PASS**

All identified gaps have a final disposition:

- management listener accidentally gated → explicitly excluded in v1;
- runtime reload interpreted as active connection revocation → generation pinning preserved;
- disabled mode conflated with no database provisioning → request enforcement and process maintenance separated;
- `check-config` at risk of live readiness/network dependency → exact `runCheckConfigCommand -> runtimebundle.ValidateStructural` static path;
- literal cache requirement creates memory-DoS risk → reader reuse/no request backend is baseline;
- broad `classifyAccess` would force restarts → field-level reload/restart classification required;
- early denial cannot use frontend renderer → generic 403 owned by ingress adapter;
- no-country confused with lookup failure → explicit three-state lookup semantics;
- memory-mapped reader replacement unsafe → synchronized unique-version publication/retirement;
- blocked requests bypass general observability → dedicated bounded GeoIP metrics by design.

No unresolved P0/P1 brownfield gap remains.

## Post-Review Hardening Review

**Decision: PASS**

The first PR review identified eight actionable inline findings and two additional material ambiguities. They were accepted only after independent verification and are now normative in `design.md` / `tasks.md`.

### 1. Policy immutability — RESOLVED

Published policy no longer conceptually exposes mutable maps/slices. The compiler owns/deep-copies backing data; collections remain private; no mutable accessor/mutator crosses the generation boundary. Tests must prove caller-side mutation cannot change a published decision or race readers.

### 2. Forwarding limits — RESOLVED

Arbitrary `MaxHeaderBytes`/`MaxHops` fields were removed from the generation contract. V1 uses fixed shared 16 KiB / 32-hop security constants, with tests consuming the same definitions.

### 3. Repeated forwarding-header fields — RESOLVED

All instances of the configured authoritative header are flattened in received order and parsed as one chain. Aggregate byte/hop bounds cover the full repeated-field set; `Header.Get`/first-field semantics are insufficient and prohibited for authority resolution.

### 4. Crash-durable LKG publication/recovery — RESOLVED

The spec now requires explicit platform durability:

- Unix: candidate `fsync`, close, unique-version rename, parent-dir `fsync`; manifest temp `fsync`, atomic same-directory replacement, parent-dir `fsync`.
- Windows: write-through/flush + close and a narrow atomic/write-through metadata replacement primitive; no delete/copy non-atomic fallback.

Any publication failure preserves the prior manifest/active LKG. Managed restart strictly validates manifest target then deterministically scans retained verified versions when needed and repairs the manifest through the same durable protocol before reader activation.

### 5. Updater vs `ProcessServices.Close` — RESOLVED

The process service now has closed state, updater root cancellation, in-flight update tracking, and a publication fence. `Close` establishes closed/cancelled state first, waits active acquisitions/updates without holding the lifecycle lock, then closes active readers/files. Tests race shutdown against download, write, Verify, manifest boundary, and reader publication.

### 6. MaxMind `DownloadResponse.Reader` ownership — RESOLVED

The updater adapter owns/closes every non-nil response reader, including unchanged responses. Changed readers are consumed through the hard size/time bounds and closed before verification/publication. Failure paths close all resources; hard limit/timeout never triggers unbounded draining.

### 7. Local vs managed startup — RESOLVED

Local source opens only configured `local_path`, never reads MaxMind credentials, never scans managed LKG versions, and never performs managed acquisition. Managed mode alone owns manifest recovery/acquisition/scheduling.

### 8. Exact static `check-config` entry — RESOLVED

The normative path is existing `runCheckConfigCommand -> runtimebundle.ValidateStructural`. GeoIP adds pure static compile/validation there without `BuildHost`, `ProcessServices`, generation publication, MMDB acquisition/open, updater construction, or MaxMind network.

### 9. Normative resource constants — RESOLVED

The design/tasks define one shared v1 bound contract and make tests/config validation refer to it rather than vague "bounded" defaults.

## Design Validation Review

**Decision: PASS**

The final design resolves all original and subsequent NO-GO ambiguities:

- cycle-neutral composition DTO;
- static vs live validation;
- enforceable immutable policy;
- repeated-header trust semantics;
- fixed resource bounds;
- source-specific process construction;
- explicit update response ownership;
- crash-durable platform publication/recovery;
- reader-close synchronization;
- updater/Close publication fence.

## Architecture Review

### SOLID — PASS

- **SRP:** policy, HTTP address resolution, MMDB lifecycle, update transport, configuration, metrics, and composition remain separate.
- **OCP:** alternate `CountryLookup` adapters can be added without changing policy; deliberate address-source modes can extend the HTTP adapter.
- **LSP:** fake/local/MMDB lookups share found/not-found/error semantics.
- **ISP:** request gate sees only immutable policy/lookup/resolver/observer, not updater/files/credentials.
- **DIP:** core owns the country lookup port; MaxMind is an infrastructure adapter.

### Hexagonal architecture — PASS

- core domain owns policy semantics;
- HTTP is a driving adapter;
- MMDB/MaxMind/files are driven adapters;
- runtimebundle is the composition root;
- process resources and immutable request generations retain existing ownership;
- no global service locator or parallel reload/control plane.

### Extension-platform fit — PASS

GeoIP remains deliberately **not** a generic LLM FeatureBundle stage. It is transport ingress security and lives in `stdhttp`, consistent with the repository's separation of transport authentication from later canonical LLM stages.

## Security Review

**Decision: PASS**

The spec explicitly defends against:

- spoofed forwarded headers from untrusted direct peers;
- attacker-prepended and repeated-field forwarding values;
- split-across-field byte/hop limit bypass;
- malformed/oversized forwarding chains;
- IPv4-mapped IPv6 matching bypass;
- mutable published policy state;
- fail-open country lookup/readiness behavior;
- unexpected MaxMind network in local mode or `check-config`;
- response-body/file/goroutine leaks in repeated updater flows;
- corrupt/truncated/oversized MMDB updates;
- torn/non-durable manifest publication;
- invalid-manifest restart ambiguity;
- updater publication after process Close begins;
- closing a reader during active lookup;
- Windows mapped-file replacement/deletion problems;
- unbounded per-IP cache growth;
- high-cardinality metrics/log spam;
- credential leakage;
- accidental management-plane lockout.

The operator documentation task still requires the limitation statement: GeoIP is approximate defense in depth and not identity/citizenship/sanctions-compliance proof.

## Request-Path Cost Review

**Decision: PASS**

Disabled generation:

```text
no GeoIP wrapper -> no resolver -> no policy call -> no lookup
```

Enabled path:

- precompiled private `netip` rule state;
- fixed-bounds client-address parsing;
- local long-lived reader only when country can affect decision;
- no filesystem/network/DNS/config parsing;
- no mandatory per-IP cache.

The task plan requires benchmarks before trie/cache optimization.

## Lifecycle and Reload Review

**Decision: PASS**

- local and managed startup paths are explicit and cannot silently cross network/lifecycle boundaries;
- process service may be provisioned/warm while enforcement is off;
- generation owns only immutable policy projection/wrapper presence;
- pure policy reloads atomically;
- database/updater changes restart-required;
- enable fails if required process lookup is absent/not ready;
- disabled publishes wrapper-free generation;
- existing in-flight work stays generation-pinned;
- management listener remains process-owned and outside data-plane GeoIP;
- process shutdown cancels/waits updater operations before closing service resources.

## Task Plan Review

**Decision: PASS**

The implementation plan still contains **32 bounded TDD-oriented sub-tasks** across ten phases:

1. RED policy/config/reload contracts.
2. Pure immutable policy core.
3. HTTP client-address trust boundary.
4. Local MMDB process service.
5. Managed updater/LKG/durable storage/shutdown.
6. Bounded observability.
7. Process ownership and cycle-neutral generation projection.
8. Exact early HTTP middleware integration.
9. Reload/generation-pinning/management-plane certification.
10. Security fuzz/race, performance, docs, and release gates.

High-risk review findings have explicit test owners rather than being left as prose-only implementation advice.

## Requirement-to-Task Coverage

**Decision: PASS**

Every Requirement 1-15 is referenced by implementation and validation tasks. High-risk contracts (R1, R6, R8-R10, R13-R15) have multiple independent validation layers.

No requirement depends on a future unspecified follow-up to make the feature safe.

## Explicit Deferred Scope

The following remain intentionally deferred:

- city/ASN/VPN/threat intelligence;
- PROXY protocol;
- CDN/cloud-vendor-specific client-IP headers;
- management-listener GeoIP policy;
- distributed fleet updater coordination;
- active revocation of already admitted long-lived connections;
- provider/frontend-specific denial schemas;
- per-IP cache or prefix trie without benchmark evidence;
- OS/cloud firewall rule management.

These deferrals do not prevent #387's requested feature from being complete.

## Spec-Only PR Gate

Branch changes remain restricted to:

```text
.kiro/specs/geoip-ingress-access-control/**
```

No `.go`, module dependency, workflow, configuration example outside the spec directory, or production documentation file belongs in this PR.

## Final Decision

**SPEC REVIEW PASS — READY FOR MAINTAINER APPROVAL, NOT APPROVED FOR IMPLEMENTATION.**

The required `check-config` static entry, crash-durable manifest protocol/recovery, and updater-versus-close contract are now normative and have explicit implementation tests. The SDD is internally consistent and implementation-plannable for issue #387.

The implementation gate remains maintainer approval; `spec.json` intentionally leaves every approval and `ready_for_implementation` false.
