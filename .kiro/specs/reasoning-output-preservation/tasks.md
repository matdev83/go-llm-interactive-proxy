# Implementation Plan

**Source context:** GitHub issue [#157 — Reasoning output preservation](https://github.com/matdev83/go-llm-interactive-proxy/issues/157)

> **TDD gate:** Phase 1 introduces public/canonical interfaces, fixtures, and failing executable contracts only. Production runners, stores, feature behavior, and adapter mappings begin in Phase 2. Every later task starts from a focused red test, implements the smallest correct change, and refactors only after the focused package is green.

## Phase 1 — RED: Contracts, Fixtures, and Failing Acceptance Tests

- [x] 1.1 Freeze canonical reasoning and hard replay contracts
  - Add contract shapes and red tests for assistant-only ordered reasoning, dialect/payload validation, byte/count limits, deep cloning, sizing/counting/checkpoint participation, and non-downgradable `reasoning_replay`.
  - Add fixtures for text reasoning, signed thinking, redacted/opaque thinking, multiple blocks, and interleaved tool calls.
  - **Deliverable:** reviewable canonical tests fail only because the contracts are not implemented.
  - _Requirements: 2.1–2.8, 9.1, 9.3_
  - _Design rules: D1, D5, D13_
  - _Boundary: `pkg/lipapi` contracts and tests_
  - _Depends: approved requirements and design_
  - _Validation: focused `go test ./pkg/lipapi/`_

- [x] 1.2 Define attempt-transform contracts and red ordering tests
  - Add `AttemptTransform`, candidate metadata, replay support, `continue`, and `exclude_candidate` shapes plus optional schema-V1 bundle contribution.
  - Prove the stage must run on `CloneCall(baseline)` after interleaved shaping and before final capabilities, context eligibility, preflight, backend-ingress freeze, authorization, and `Open`.
  - **Deliverable:** extension/runtime tests define the missing candidate stage and failover semantics without production implementation.
  - _Requirements: 5.1–5.10, 9.1, 9.4_
  - _Design rules: D2, D3, D5, D11, D13_
  - _Boundary: `pkg/lipsdk/request`, core extensions/runtime, tests_
  - _Depends: 1.1_
  - _Validation: focused request-extension and executor tests_

- [x] 1.3 Define final-stream observer contracts and red lifecycle tests
  - Add observer factory, read-only observer, metadata, and exactly-once outcomes for success release, failure, cancellation, early close, replacement, and gate replacement.
  - Prove observers receive post-response-hook/post-gate events, do not enable completion buffering, and open only for the active surfaced B-leg.
  - **Deliverable:** every commit/discard terminal path is executable before a runner exists.
  - _Requirements: 3.1–3.9, 8.7, 9.1, 9.4_
  - _Design rules: D2, D4, D9, D11, D13_
  - _Boundary: `pkg/lipsdk/response`, core runtime, tests_
  - _Depends: 1.1_
  - _Validation: focused observer, recv, gate, close, and parallel tests_

- [x] 1.4 Add red feature-domain, store, and privacy tests
  - Cover strict config, catalog precedence, exact normalized anchors, placement, preserved/missing/conflicting/ambiguous/unmatched classification, idempotent restoration, and unrepresentable/state policies.
  - Define a TurnStore contract for TTL, turn/per-turn/session bounds, atomic append/eviction, defensive copies, session/plugin isolation, and concurrency.
  - **Deliverable:** feature behavior is specified before config, store, matcher, observer, or transform implementation.

- [x] 1.5 Add red adapter goldens and composed routing scenarios
  - Add Chat, Responses, Anthropic, OpenRouter/compatible, and explicit Gemini-unsupported request/response fixtures.
  - Add disabled, sequential/recv failover, context-limit-after-restoration, weighted, parallel, response-hook mutation, and gate-replacement scenarios.
  - **Deliverable:** protocol and routing gaps are reproducible without provider network calls.
