# Implementation Plan

## Current Implementation Checkpoint

Fresh assessment of the uncommitted worktree recognizes **8 of 8 tasks in Phases 1–2 as complete**: 1.1–1.4 and 2.1–2.4. All tasks in Phases 3–7 remain unstarted.

Completed Phase 1–2 work:

- **1.2:** complete. The deterministic five-frontend/1,000-profile fixture explicitly proves profile #1000 identity, four-family binding, and scans the representative structure for frontend×profile collections, nested materializers, per-profile factories/registrations/goroutines, central-list edits, and sentinel growth. Clean footprint evidence is obtained from an isolated temporary Git repository and Git-produced diff; isolated positive/negative mutation fixtures cover every structural category.
- **1.4:** complete. Ordinary architecture tests pass and the tagged target reports only enumerated current debts. Authority-aware AST mutation fixtures preserve distinct same-symbol paths and cover arbitrary contribution/diagnostic row/projector/state false positives; structural Go/protobuf ABI checks reject arbitrary synthetic qualifiers while preserving neutral semantic carriers and exact v1.0-v1.3 declarations/legacy OpenResponses exception, including multiline/comment resilience.
- **2.2:** complete. Five mounted frontends independently certify their declared semantic surfaces with explicit positive canonical-call and wire-output evidence; OpenResponses lifecycle remains protocol-owned.
- **2.3:** complete. Every standard in-process family passes the reusable capability-driven suite with tool lifecycle, usage/zero presence, errors/cancellation, hard-negative zero-upstream, and false-capability evidence. The suite uses structured request controls and bounded cancellation probes.
- **2.4:** complete. `pkg/lipsdk/backendplugin/host` is the single public host implementation; the internal adapter delegates to it, ACP/OpenRouter/NVIDIA use it, and a separate external-style module compiles the public host path. The host retains Resolve/ListModels/Execute/Cancel/Close, negotiation, terminal/error/bounds behavior, CountTokens, and FinalizeBilling; compile-time and real bufconn regressions prove both optional capabilities remain visible through the internal alias and adapter. The shared contract result remains machine-readable.

Current fresh validation evidence:

- Green: Phase 1 characterization packages; ordinary architecture/scale packages (with the root-only enterprise compile gate excluded); canonical-core TCK; frontend TCK plus all frontend packages; root backend-plugin/tool/host-adapter packages; ACP/OpenRouter/NVIDIA module contract tests; host optional accounting/lifecycle regressions; `go build ./...`; `gofmt -d`; `git diff --check`.
- Expected RED: `go test -tags=architecture_red -run 'TestRED_' ./internal/archtest` reports exactly the current five debt categories.
- No unexpected RED remains in the Phase 1–2 TCK suites.

## 1. Freeze Brownfield Behavior and Add RED Architecture Contracts

- [x] 1.1 Freeze current conformance, contribution, route, diagnostics, ABI, and continuation baselines
  - Characterize `BundledFrontendIDs`, `BundledBackendIDs`, `AllCells`, current required feature IDs/scenario IDs, standard/essential/compatible backend lists, frontend route claims, compatible/OpenResponses diagnostics, backend-plugin v1.0–v1.3 negotiation, and continuation store/recorder behavior.
  - Commit a machine-readable baseline inventory of Cartesian-only files/functions/lines at baseline SHA `95089eb4b74d5cf8d062f238a1121124ce0da878`.
  - Record current diagnostic JSON shapes before generic projection changes.
  - Observable completion: characterization passes on unmodified baseline behavior and produces stable legacy-surface evidence.
  - _Requirements: 1.1–1.10, 10.1–10.2, 11.6–11.7, 12.1–12.2, 12.6, 13.11_
  - _Design rules: D1, D12–D14, D16–D18_
  - _Boundary: tests/evidence only_
  - _Depends: none_
  - _Validation: go test ./internal/testkit/conformance/... ./internal/standardplugins/... ./internal/stdhttp/contract/... ./pkg/lipsdk/backendplugin/... ./pkg/lipsdk/continuation/... ./internal/core/continuation/..._

- [x] 1.2 Add RED non-Cartesian scale and extension-footprint contracts
  - Build synthetic five-frontend / 1,000-provider-profile fixtures.
  - Assert profile additions do not create frontend×profile pair collections, family factories, central compatible/essential list edits, or sentinel growth.
  - Add a provider-profile-only fixture whose expected shared-boundary footprint is zero.
  - Observable completion: tests fail against the current matrix/parallel-registry architecture for the intended reasons.
  - _Requirements: 2.1–2.10, 6.11, 7.5, 12.8, 13.3, 13.7_
  - _Design rules: D2, D5, D7, D15, D18_
  - _Boundary: architecture/test fixtures_
  - _Depends: 1.1_
  - _Validation: go test ./internal/archtest/... ./internal/testkit/..._

- [x] 1.3 Add RED contract-test-kit interfaces and semantic scenario metadata
  - Define test-only/supported dependency-neutral semantic feature IDs, scenario IDs, subject descriptors, certification DTOs, and narrow frontend/backend harness contracts.
  - Keep executable scenario builders out of production runtime packages.
  - Add compile-time tests proving third-party connector-facing contract types do not import `internal` or concrete backend packages.
  - Observable completion: interfaces/metadata compile and RED runner tests specify expected scenario selection/evidence before runners exist.
  - _Requirements: 3.1–3.3, 3.7–3.10, 4.1–4.3, 4.9–4.10, 5.1, 10.10, 13.1_
  - _Design rules: D1–D4, D8, D14_
  - _Boundary: test contract/API definitions_
  - _Depends: 1.1_
  - _Validation: go test ./internal/testkit/contract/... ./pkg/lipsdk/backendplugin/contracttest/..._

- [x] 1.4 Add RED contribution/profile/ABI/mirror architecture guards
  - Add tests that reject duplicate authoritative extension registries, central protocol-specific route kinds, protocol-ID diagnostic switches, new protocol-named backend-plugin features/proto fields beyond the v1.3 compatibility allowlist, provider profiles imported by core, and duplicate continuation authorities.
  - Add explicit allowlist for current legacy v1.3 OpenResponses ABI symbols only.
  - Observable completion: current known gaps fail the new guards while existing legitimate provider dialect IDs remain allowed.
  - _Requirements: 7.1–7.10, 8.1–8.8, 10.3, 10.11, 11.1–11.9, 13.1–13.4_
  - _Design rules: D7–D13, D18_
  - _Boundary: internal/archtest_
  - _Depends: 1.1_
  - _Validation: go test ./internal/archtest/..._


### Phase 1–2 completion evidence (tasks 1.1–1.4 and 2.1–2.4)
- `go test -count=1 ./internal/testkit/scale/...` passes; the scale suite uses deterministic temporary Git repositories and Git-produced diffs plus isolated mutation fixtures.
- `go test -count=1 ./internal/archtest` passes, including the separate external-style public-host compile gate. The root-only enterprise gate is separately blocked on Linux by its administrative-user refusal.
- Opt-in RED command: `go test -count=1 -tags=architecture_red -run 'TestRED_' ./internal/archtest` is RED only for current Cartesian 45-cell/AllCells debt, parallel essential/compatible contribution lists, central protocol-specific route kinds, central diagnostic DTO debt, and duplicate continuation MemoryStore/StreamRecorder authorities.
- Focused suites: `go test -count=1 ./internal/testkit/contract/... ./pkg/lipsdk/backendplugin/...`; `go test -count=1 ./internal/refbackend/... ./internal/plugins/backends/protocols/geminigenerate/...`; and `go test -count=1 ./...` in ACP, OpenRouter, and NVIDIA connector modules.

## 2. Build Frontend, Core, Backend, and Connector TCKs

  - _Requirements: 3.1–3.7, 3.9–3.10, 1.2–1.4_
  - _Design rules: D1–D4, D14_
  - _Boundary: internal/testkit/contract/backend + backend tests_
  - _Depends: 1.3, 2.1_
  - _Validation: go test ./internal/testkit/contract/backend/... ./internal/plugins/backends/..._

- [x] 2.4 Implement the supported executable-connector contract test entry point
  - Drive negotiation/configure/execute/cancel/close through the real backend-plugin host adapter.
  - Reuse the same semantic scenario source as 2.3; do not fork a connector-specific feature catalog.
  - Add at least ACP/OpenRouter/NVIDIA/current connector representatives and a fake external-style connector fixture.
  - Observable completion: connector authors can invoke one supported SDK contract test and receive machine-readable certification evidence.
  - _Requirements: 3.7–3.10, 10.9–10.10, 13.1_

## 3. Introduce Provider Families and Typed Provider Profiles

- [x] 3.1 Define the provider-profile v1 schema and RED validation suite
  - Define typed versioned profile contracts for family, endpoint/path policy, credential references, safe headers, model discovery/namespace, tokenizer/accounting, capability/dialect overrides, and closed family quirks.

  - Observable completion: schema tests define safe declarative boundaries before catalog/runtime implementation.
  - _Requirements: 6.1–6.5, 6.7–6.8, 6.12_
  - _Design rules: D5–D6, D9–D10_
  - _Boundary: internal/providerprofiles contract/tests_
  - _Depends: 1.2_
  - _Validation: go test ./internal/providerprofiles/..._

- [x] 3.2 Implement deterministic embedded provider-profile catalog and family binding
  - Add one source-of-truth profile catalog loaded through `go:embed` or deterministic generated typed values.
  - Bind profiles to existing compatible family adapters without one Go factory registration per provider.
  - Preserve arbitrary custom-compatible user configuration independently from the shipped profile catalog.
  - Observable completion: current/synthetic profiles resolve to family configurations through one compiler and require no provider network/process activation.
  - _Requirements: 6.2–6.7, 6.9, 6.12, 7.5_
  - _Design rules: D5–D8_
  - _Boundary: provider profile catalog + standard composition_
  - _Depends: 3.1_
  - _Validation: go test ./internal/providerprofiles/... ./internal/standardplugins/... ./internal/infra/runtimebundle/..._

- [x] 3.3 Implement profile certification and 1,000-profile scale proof
  - Certify family binding, endpoint/auth/header/model behavior, effective capability/dialect calculation, and declared quirks without frontend multiplication.
  - Add 1,000-profile synthetic catalog load/validation tests and assert zero provider network/process starts and no per-profile goroutine.
  - Observable completion: profile #1000 costs one profile certification path and does not affect frontend TCK/sentinel counts.
  - _Requirements: 2.2–2.7, 6.7–6.11, 12.8_
  - _Design rules: D2–D6, D15_
  - _Boundary: profile TCK/scale tests_
  - _Depends: 3.2, 2.3_
  - _Validation: go test ./internal/providerprofiles/... ./internal/testkit/contract/backend/..._

  - Reuse existing immutable candidate/generation compilation and startup security validation.
  - Prove profile catalog changes rebuild affected family instances without a second mutable registry.
  - Keep profile values secret-safe and provider processes dormant during validation.
  - Observable completion: startup/check-config/reload characterization remains coherent for profile-backed compatible instances.
  - _Requirements: 1.5–1.6, 6.7–6.9, 8.5–8.7_
  - _Design rules: D5–D8_
  - _Boundary: runtimebundle/configreload composition only_
  - _Depends: 3.2_
  - _Validation: go test ./internal/infra/runtimebundle/... ./internal/core/configreload/... ./internal/standardplugins/..._

### Phase 3 completion evidence (tasks 3.1-3.4)
- `internal/providerprofiles` now owns the typed v1 contract, closed JSON/YAML decoding, bounds, endpoint/auth/header/model/accounting/dialect/quirk validation, deterministic catalog ordering, immutable family compilation, embedded catalog, and negative mutation tests.
- `internal/standardplugins` exposes one profile compiler/family binding path and secret-safe diagnostics; existing opaque custom-compatible rows remain on their original configuration path. Startup effective validation validates the embedded catalog without adapter activation.
- The profile package scale test validates 1,000 profiles and profile `provider-1000` through one family compilation path; the package has no I/O, process, or goroutine activation surface.
- Focused green evidence: `go test ./internal/providerprofiles/... ./internal/standardplugins/... ./internal/core/configreload/... ./internal/testkit/contract/backend/...`; runtime generation characterization: `go test ./internal/infra/runtimebundle -run 'TestBuildHost|TestEffectiveLoadContract|TestCompileGeneration'`; `go build ./...`; `git diff --check`.

  - Derive `StandardBundle`, essential IDs, compatible family IDs, contract subjects, and provider-profile family bindings from one source.
  - Delete parallel authoritative lists/switches superseded by contribution facets.
  - Preserve current optional-connector rule: optional connector identities are not promoted into essential built-ins.

  - _Requirements: 7.1–7.10, 2.2–2.5_
  - _Design rules: D5, D7–D8, D17_
  - _Boundary: internal/standardplugins/internal/pluginreg composition_

  - Keep normalized owner/method/path conflict validation.
  - Move concrete operation IDs to frontend-owned contributions/protocol packages and replace central closed route-kind additions with bounded opaque IDs.

  - Observable completion: current route collision tests pass and a synthetic new frontend route requires no `stdhttp/contract` enum edit.
  - _Requirements: 8.1–8.2, 8.7–8.8, 7.4_
  - _Design rules: D7–D8, D18_
  - _Boundary: stdhttp contract + frontend contribution metadata_
  - _Depends: 4.1_
  - _Validation: go test ./internal/stdhttp/contract/... ./internal/standardplugins/... ./internal/stdhttp/..._

- [x] 4.4 Replace protocol-specific central diagnostics rows/switches with bounded generic contribution projectors
  - Characterize existing HTTP JSON first and retain compatibility serialization/versioning where needed.
  - Introduce common instance diagnostics plus bounded sanitized extension fields.
  - Move protocol-specific projection to contribution-owned side-effect-free projectors; remove OpenResponses-compatible/frontend selection switches from central composition.
  - Observable completion: operator information remains equivalent while a synthetic protocol adds diagnostics without a new core diagnostic DTO/switch.
  - _Requirements: 8.3–8.8, 7.4, 7.10_
  - _Design rules: D7–D10, D17_
  - _Boundary: internal/core/diag + standardplugins projection adapters_
  - _Depends: 4.1, 4.2_
  - _Validation: go test ./internal/core/diag/... ./internal/standardplugins/... ./internal/stdhttp/..._

## 5. Harden Canonical and Backend-Plugin Extension Boundaries

- [x] 5.1 Audit protocol-named canonical fields with characterization tests before any migration

  - Reuse existing extension carriers where sufficient; add at most one generic presence-bearing semantic residual carrier if evidence proves a gap.
  - Keep shared/core-consumed reasoning/compaction semantics first-class.
  - Preserve source compatibility through aliases/transitional fields where practical and forbid raw request/response tunneling. The audit evidence records why `Call.Extensions`, item/content carriers, and existing backend-plugin fields cannot preserve call-level presence/identity safely.
  - Observable completion: canonical first-class surface is smaller or no larger for adapter-only fidelity, with all characterization tests green.
  - _Requirements: 9.2–9.9, 1.9_
  - _Design rules: D9–D10, D17_

  - If required by 5.2, add one protocol-neutral semantic extension feature/carrier with strict bounds and exact requirement matching.
  - Preserve `exact_openresponses_fields` as legacy compatibility vocabulary; bridge without dual authority or silent loss.
  - Observable completion: current connectors negotiate exactly as before unless opting into the additive generic semantic feature.
  - _Requirements: 10.1–10.10, 1.2, 1.9_
  - _Design rules: D10–D12_
  - _Boundary: api/backendplugin/v1 + pkg/lipsdk/backendplugin + host adapter_

  - _Validation: go test ./pkg/lipsdk/backendplugin/... ./internal/infra/backendplugins/adapter/... ./tools/backendplugin/..._

- [x] 5.4 Enforce future canonical/ABI promotion policy in architecture/docs
  - Add architecture tests for new protocol-named backend-plugin feature/proto additions outside the legacy allowlist.
  - Document the canonical promotion checklist and semantic-ABI rule with positive/negative examples.
  - Observable completion: a synthetic protocol-named ABI feature fails architecture tests while a semantic carrier extension passes.
  - _Requirements: 9.10, 10.3, 10.8, 10.11, 13.8–13.10_
  - _Design rules: D9–D12, D18_

- [x] 6.1 Collapse continuation store/recorder mirrors to one authority
  - Run parity characterization against SDK/core copies first.
  - Retain `pkg/lipsdk/continuation` as default protocol-neutral contract/utility authority, retain durable infra adapters, and reduce core to orchestration/delegation.

  - _Validation: go test ./pkg/lipsdk/continuation/... ./internal/core/continuation/... ./internal/infra/continuation/..._

- [x] 6.2 Build the bounded real-stack sentinel and prove provider-count independence
  - Select representative built-in, compatible-family, connector-host, stateful frontend, and negative admission paths with explicit `Protects` rationale.
  - Add bound tests and verify 1,000 additional profiles in existing families do not change sentinel count.
  - Observable completion: sentinel catches deliberately broken composition wiring but is independent of provider population.
  - _Requirements: 5.5–5.9, 2.6–2.9, 12.8_

  - Run both systems at the same implementation head.
  - Inject representative decode, projector, false-capability, connector-field-loss, and composition faults and prove the new owner suite catches each.

  - Preserve independent emulators/compliance and reusable scenarios.
  - Enforce ≥80% deletion of baseline Cartesian-only non-generated Go lines and no net growth in reviewed affected shared surfaces.
  - Observable completion: no mandatory release path constructs all frontend×backend pairs; deletion gates pass.
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 5.10, 12.3–12.10_
  - _Design rules: D2, D14–D17_
  - _Boundary: internal/testkit/conformance, Makefile/workflows as needed_

- [ ] 7.1 Implement extension change-surface reporting and hard profile-only boundary checks

  - _Design rules: D7–D12, D17–D18_
  - _Boundary: internal/archtest_
  - _Depends: 4.2–4.4, 5.4, 6.4_
  - _Validation: go test ./internal/archtest/..._

- [ ] 7.3 Publish extension/provider authoring and conformance documentation
  - Document decision tree: provider profile vs family adapter vs executable connector.
  - Document profile schema/security, contribution facets, frontend/backend/connector TCK entry points, sentinel purpose, canonical promotion checklist, semantic ABI evolution, and change-surface review.
