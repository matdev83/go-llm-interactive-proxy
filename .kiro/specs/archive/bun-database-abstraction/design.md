# Design Document

## Overview

This feature adds managed-durable database support to the Go LLM Interactive Proxy persistence layer while preserving current memory and SQLite behavior. Operators gain independent persistence choices for B2BUA continuity and secure sessions; maintainers keep the existing consumer-owned store contracts and explicit runtime wiring.

The design uses a hybrid extension approach: current SQLite runtime paths remain valid, and new Bun-backed adapters provide the managed-durable path. Bun and database driver details stay inside infrastructure and store adapter packages; no public canonical, SDK, frontend, backend, or plugin contract exposes the database abstraction.

### Goals
- Support independently configured memory, local durable, and managed durable stores for continuity and secure sessions.
- Preserve observable behavior for current memory and SQLite deployments.
- Add Bun-backed persistence behind existing store ports with explicit startup validation, secret-safe errors, and deterministic shutdown.
- Provide parity tests for durable behavior and optional PostgreSQL integration validation.

### Non-Goals
- No automatic migration between SQLite and PostgreSQL or between local and managed databases.
- No changes to client-facing LLM protocols, canonical request/event contracts, routing semantics, or plugin SDK contracts.
- No distributed coordination guarantee beyond the selected database backend's store behavior.
- No replacement of existing SQLite adapters as the default `store: sqlite` path in this design.

## Boundary Commitments

### This Spec Owns
- Config semantics for selecting `memory`, `sqlite`, or `postgres` persistence independently for continuity and secure sessions.
- Shared internal database helpers for opening PostgreSQL, wrapping `*sql.DB` with Bun, applying pool settings, and redacting connection details from errors; these helpers are platform infrastructure, not business-facing ports.
- Bun-backed store adapters for continuity and secure sessions that implement existing ports.
- Runtime wiring, closers, validation, sample config, and tests for the new managed-durable path.

### Out of Boundary
- Public contract changes in `pkg/lipapi`, `pkg/lipsdk`, frontend plugins, backend plugins, or feature plugin contracts.
- Automatic data migration, data export/import commands, or schema migration tooling beyond idempotent adapter-owned table preparation.
- Changes to core routing/failover behavior, no-retry-after-output behavior, canonical streaming, or protocol translation.
- Provider SDK integration or provider-specific semantics.

### Allowed Dependencies
- Existing store ports: `internal/core/b2bua.Store`, `internal/core/securesession/app.Store`, and `app.SessionUsageRollup`.
- Existing runtime composition roots: `internal/core/continuity.OpenStore`, `internal/infra/runtimebundle.Build`, and `buildSecureSessionRuntime`.
- New internal database infrastructure in `internal/infra/db`; only composition/runtime wiring and concrete store adapters may import it.
- `github.com/uptrace/bun` with SQLite and PostgreSQL dialect packages, plus Bun PostgreSQL driver support pinned in `go.mod` during implementation.
- Current `modernc.org/sqlite` driver for existing SQLite adapters.

### Hexagonal Dependency Rules
- `internal/infra/db` must not define business-facing ports, domain concepts, or use-case orchestration.
- Bun-backed store packages are concrete driven adapters. Core orchestration depends only on `b2bua.Store`, `app.Store`, and `SessionUsageRollup`; concrete adapters are selected only at factory and composition seams.
- No `*sql.DB`, `*sql.Tx`, `*bun.DB`, Bun query builder, SQL driver, or database driver error type may cross existing store ports.
- Transaction mechanics are adapter-owned for single store operations in this feature; transaction intent visible to core remains the existing store method call boundary.

### Revalidation Triggers
- Any change to `b2bua.Store`, `app.Store`, `SessionUsageRollup`, or `pkg/lipsdk/continuity` contracts.
- Any change that routes `store: sqlite` through Bun instead of the existing SQLite adapters.
- Any change to canonical request/event contracts, client-facing protocols, or routing semantics.
- Any change to database config field names, durable audit gating, startup failure behavior, or secret redaction rules.

## Architecture

### Existing Architecture Analysis

The existing runtime already uses clean store seams. Continuity is opened first through `continuity.OpenStore`, then secure sessions are built using `buildSecureSessionRuntime` and a lineage adapter over the same `b2bua.Store`. Both domains already have memory and SQLite adapters, and the runtime collects closers for stores that own database resources.

The main current limitations are enum/config support, lack of PostgreSQL open/wrap infrastructure, lack of Bun-backed adapters, and no optional PostgreSQL validation harness.

### Architecture Pattern & Boundary Map

Selected pattern: ports-and-adapters extension with shared internal infrastructure. The store ports remain consumer-owned; Bun-backed adapters and database helpers are implementation details.

    BunContinuity --> DBInfra[Internal db infra]
    BunSession --> DBInfra
    DBInfra --> PostgreSQL[PostgreSQL]
    DBInfra --> BunLib[Bun library]
```

Key decisions:
- `sqlite` remains on existing raw-SQL SQLite adapters for backward compatibility.
- `postgres` uses Bun-backed adapters.
- In-memory behavior is unchanged.
- Shared connection reuse is deferred; each configured PostgreSQL store owns its own database handle unless a later design adds safe ownership semantics.

## System Flows

### Startup Store Selection

```mermaid

    participant Main as lipstd
    participant Config as Config validation
    participant Bundle as Runtime bundle
    participant Cont as Continuity factory
    participant Sec as Secure builder
    participant DB as Database infra
    participant Store as Store adapters
    Main->>Config: validate config
    Config-->>Main: accepted or error
    Main->>Bundle: build runtime
    Bundle->>Cont: open continuity store
    Cont->>DB: open postgres if selected
    DB-->>Cont: database handle
    Cont-->>Bundle: b2bua store

    Sec->>DB: open postgres if selected
    DB-->>Sec: database handle
    Sec-->>Bundle: app store and closer
    Bundle-->>Main: runtime and closers
```

Startup fails at the selected store boundary when database preparation fails. No fallback to memory or SQLite is allowed for explicit durable selections.

### Infrastructure Layer

#### Database Infrastructure

| Field | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Intent | Centralize internal database opening, Bun dialect wrapping, pool tuning, and secret-safe redaction. |
| Requirements | 1.6, 2.6, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 |

**Responsibilities & Constraints**
- Owns `OpenPostgres`, `NewBunDB`, `ApplyPoolSettings`, and `RedactDSN`-style helpers.
- Does not expose Bun or SQL handles to public packages.
- Does not define store ports, domain interfaces, or application use-case contracts.
- May be imported only by runtime composition code and concrete store adapters.
- Applies pool settings only when configured; zero values preserve driver defaults.
- Pings/prepares selected managed database before returning a usable store handle.

**Service Interface**
```go
type Dialect string

const (
    DialectSQLite   Dialect = "sqlite"
    DialectPostgres Dialect = "postgres"
)

type PoolSettings struct {
    MaxOpenConns    int
    MaxIdleConns    int
    ConnMaxLifetime time.Duration
    ConnMaxIdleTime time.Duration
}

func OpenPostgres(dsn string) (*sql.DB, error)
func NewBunDB(sqldb *sql.DB, dialect Dialect) (*bun.DB, error)
func ApplyPoolSettings(sqldb *sql.DB, settings PoolSettings)
func RedactDSN(dsn string) string
```

Preconditions: DSN is non-empty for PostgreSQL; dialect is known; `*sql.DB` is non-nil. Postconditions: callers receive an owned handle or an error safe to wrap without leaking secrets.

### Core Config Layer

#### Config Validation

| Field | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Intent | Keep operator-facing store selection and tuning validation explicit before runtime build. |
| Requirements | 1.1-1.8, 3.5, 3.6, 4.1, 4.2, 4.5 |

**Responsibilities & Constraints**
- Extends store values to `memory`, `sqlite`, `postgres`.
- Adds `Database DatabaseConfig` to the top-level runtime config and validates it from `Validate` before runtime build.
- Adds `PostgresDSN` to continuity and secure-session config.
- Adds top-level shared `DatabaseConfig` for pool tuning; this applies to PostgreSQL handles created by this feature.
- Treats durable audit as allowed for `sqlite` or `postgres`, rejected for `memory`.

**Config Contract**
```go
type Config struct {
    Database      DatabaseConfig      `yaml:"database"`
    Continuity    ContinuityConfig    `yaml:"continuity"`
    SecureSession SecureSessionConfig `yaml:"secure_session"`
}

type DatabaseConfig struct {
    MaxOpenConns    int    `yaml:"max_open_conns"`
    MaxIdleConns    int    `yaml:"max_idle_conns"`
    ConnMaxLifetime string `yaml:"conn_max_lifetime"`
    ConnMaxIdleTime string `yaml:"conn_max_idle_time"`
}

type ContinuityConfig struct {
    Store       string `yaml:"store"`
    SQLitePath  string `yaml:"sqlite_path"`
    PostgresDSN string `yaml:"postgres_dsn"`
}

type SecureSessionConfig struct {
    Store       string `yaml:"store"`
    SQLitePath  string `yaml:"sqlite_path"`
    PostgresDSN string `yaml:"postgres_dsn"`
}
```

The shown structs are partial; existing fields remain intact.

### Store Adapter Layer

#### Continuity Bun Store

| Field | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Intent | Provide managed durable continuity while preserving `b2bua.Store` semantics. |
| Requirements | 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 5.4, 6.1 |

**Responsibilities & Constraints**
- Implements all `b2bua.Store` methods without changing method signatures.
- Acts as a driven adapter selected only by the continuity factory or runtime composition path.
- Keeps `*sql.DB`, `*bun.DB`, Bun query builders, SQL driver errors, and transaction handles inside the adapter boundary.
- Uses transactions for A-leg resolution/create and B-leg sequence allocation.
- Uses explicit ordering for loaded attempts.
- Owns dialect-aware table preparation for the continuity schema.
- Implements `Close() error` by closing the Bun handle it owns.

**State Management**
- A-leg rows remain keyed by A-leg ID with a unique non-empty continuity key.
- B-leg sequence increments are protected by a database transaction.
- Attempt records are upserted by A-leg/B-leg/sequence identity where applicable.

#### Secure Session Bun Store

| Field | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Intent | Provide managed durable secure-session storage with contract parity. |
| Requirements | 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 5.4, 6.2 |

**Responsibilities & Constraints**
- Implements `app.Store` and `app.SessionUsageRollup` without changing public contracts.
- Acts as a driven adapter selected only by secure-session runtime composition.
- Keeps `*sql.DB`, `*bun.DB`, Bun query builders, SQL driver errors, and transaction handles inside the adapter boundary.
- Preserves transaction boundaries for attempt trace/outcome, transcript, audit, and usage writes.
- Preserves monotonic last-activity behavior.
- Owns dialect-aware table preparation for secure-session tables.
- Does not change diagnostics or manager APIs.

**State Management**
- Session ID remains the aggregate root.
- Attempt traces and usage evidence remain append/update records associated with session, turn, and B-leg identifiers.
- Summary queries remain read-only projections over stored session evidence.

### Composition Layer

#### Runtime Wiring

| Field | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Intent | Connect validated config to the correct store implementations and lifecycle ownership. |
| Requirements | 1.1-1.8, 2.6, 3.5, 4.4, 5.1-5.5 |

**Responsibilities & Constraints**
- Adds `postgres` branches for continuity and secure-session stores.
- Preserves existing memory and SQLite branches.
- Fails startup when selected durable stores cannot open or prepare.
- Appends store closers exactly once per owned handle.
- Does not share PostgreSQL handles between domains in this design.

## Data Models

### Domain Model

The feature does not introduce new domain entities. It reuses existing persistence concepts:
- Continuity: A-leg, B-leg, continuity key, weighted-first-consumed marker, attempt record.
- Secure session: session, resume fingerprint, turn, attempt trace, transcript item, audit item, usage item, summary projection.

### Logical Data Model

```mermaid
erDiagram
    CONTINUITY_A_LEG ||--o{ CONTINUITY_ATTEMPT : records
    SECURE_SESSION ||--o{ SECURE_TURN : contains
    SECURE_SESSION ||--o{ SECURE_ATTEMPT_TRACE : records
    SECURE_SESSION ||--o{ SECURE_TRANSCRIPT : captures
    SECURE_SESSION ||--o{ SECURE_AUDIT : audits
    SECURE_SESSION ||--o{ SECURE_USAGE : accounts
```

### Physical Data Model

Physical table names and columns follow existing SQLite store schemas where possible. Dialect-specific DDL is adapter-owned and explicit SQL. PostgreSQL equivalents must preserve:
- primary keys and unique constraints,
- partial uniqueness for non-empty continuity/session keys,
- indexes used by summary, lookup, and attempt evidence queries,
- foreign-key cascade behavior for secure-session child rows,
- integer timestamp storage compatible with existing `time.Unix(0, value)` use.

## Error Handling

### Error Strategy

- Config validation errors are returned before runtime build and name the invalid field.
- Startup database errors include the affected store domain and selected backend, but not raw DSNs or credentials.
- Store operation errors wrap lower-level errors with operation context and preserve existing domain not-found behavior.
- Explicit durable store selections never fall back to memory or SQLite after a failure.

### Error Categories and Responses

| Category | Source | Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Config error | unsupported store, missing DSN, invalid pool tuning | `config.Validate` returns field-specific error. |
| Startup error | connection/ping/migration failure | Runtime build returns redacted store-specific error. |
| Not found | missing A-leg/session rows | Existing domain not-found behavior is preserved. |
| Operation error | query/transaction failure | Store wraps error with operation context. |

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- `internal/infra/db`: dialect selection rejects nil/unknown inputs; PostgreSQL opener redacts DSNs in wrapped errors; pool settings apply only valid values.
- `internal/core/config`: `postgres` store validation, missing DSN errors, durable audit with `postgres`, durable audit rejection with `memory`, pool duration/count validation.
- Bun store constructors reject nil database handles and prepare schemas for SQLite-backed test handles where applicable.

### Integration Tests
- Continuity Bun store: create/fetch/resolve A-leg, monotonic B-leg sequence, attempt upsert/load ordering, weighted-first-consumed update, restart survival for durable handles.
- Secure-session Bun store: run `storecontract.RunAll`; verify usage rollup and diagnostics summary parity.
- Runtime bundle: `postgres` selection attempts to open the configured store; explicit failure does not fallback; closers run for owned stores.

### Optional PostgreSQL Tests
- Tests requiring PostgreSQL are gated by `LIP_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN`.
- When the env var is unset, tests call `t.Skip` with an explicit message.
- When set, the test suite verifies Req 2.1-2.6 and Req 3.1-3.6 against PostgreSQL.

### Boundary Tests
- Import guard verifies Bun and PostgreSQL driver imports do not appear in `pkg/lipapi`, `pkg/lipsdk`, protocol plugin packages, or unrelated core packages outside allowed adapter/infra paths.
- Existing tests for memory and SQLite stores continue to run in default validation.

## Security Considerations

- DSNs and credentials are operator secrets; errors and logs must not include full DSNs.
- Config validation should reject NUL-containing or structurally unsafe connection settings where detectable before opening.
- No new diagnostics endpoint exposes database connection details.
- Existing diagnostics authentication requirements remain unchanged.

## Performance & Scalability

- SQLite keeps existing connection behavior, including single-open-connection tuning in current adapters.
- PostgreSQL pool tuning is optional and bounded by validation; zero values preserve driver defaults.
- Sequence allocation and secure-session append paths rely on database transactions rather than in-process locks, supporting multi-process deployments to the extent the selected database provides consistency.
- Performance validation is functional/parity oriented in this spec; load tuning is deferred unless benchmarks reveal regressions.

## Migration Strategy

- Existing memory and SQLite deployments require no data migration.
- Switching from SQLite to PostgreSQL is a manual operator migration outside this feature.
- Table preparation is idempotent for newly selected PostgreSQL stores, but it is not a cross-product migration tool.
