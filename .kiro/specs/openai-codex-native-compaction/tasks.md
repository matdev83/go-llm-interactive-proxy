# Implementation Plan

## 1. Re-baseline exact Codex item support and configuration

- [ ] 1.1 Add failing native-context configuration contract tests
  - Prove omitted configuration leaves compaction disabled and constructs no checkpoint state.
  - Cover separate reasoning request, continuity mode, compaction, bounds, and evaluation-only mode controls.
  - Reject invalid combinations and enabled app-server use.
  - Observable completion: tests define all defaults and invalid states before runtime changes.
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10_
  - _Boundary: config/wiring, tests_
  - _Depends: none_
  - _Validation: go test ./internal/service/... ./internal/codex/..._

- [ ] 1.2 Implement typed native-context configuration and lifecycle
  - Normalize reviewed defaults and hard caps.
  - Keep compaction coordinator/store absent on the disabled path.
  - Clear checkpoint/cooldown state on close.
  - Preserve existing exact client-supplied replay when automatic continuity is disabled.
  - Observable completion: configuration tests pass with no disabled-path request changes.
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 10.15_

  - _Validation: go test ./internal/service/... ./internal/codex/..._

- [ ] 1.3 Characterize merged PR #235 exact-item behavior
  - Add/retain tests proving completed reasoning capture, canonical exact dialect emission, exact replay, compaction-item retention, and plugin ABI transport.
  - Mark already-delivered behavior as a prerequisite rather than reimplementing it.
  - Cover malformed/oversize/duplicate items and content-safe errors.
  - Observable completion: the baseline suite passes on current main and identifies only new continuity/compaction gaps.
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 2.10, 10.1_

  - _Boundary: feature plugin, backend connector integration contract_
