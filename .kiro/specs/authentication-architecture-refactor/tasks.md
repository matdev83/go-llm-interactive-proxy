# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Establish auth and backend security contracts
- [ ] 1.1 Define protocol-neutral auth decision DTOs and core ports
  - In `pkg/lipsdk/auth`, add handler kinds, required levels, decision outcomes, challenge data, principal/device identity snapshots, and `InboundCallMeta` (no `net/http` types).
  - In `internal/core/auth`, add consuming ports: `Authenticator`, `RemoteDecider` (remote auth is a core consumer-side port only in this spec).
  - Include API-key-plus-SSO outcome semantics so a recognized device/app key can still produce an unmet SSO challenge or denial.
  - The `pkg/lipsdk/auth` package compiles without importing HTTP, provider SDK, enterprise transport, or canonical LLM event packages.
  - _Requirements: 1.7, 3.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.6, 12.5, 13.5_
  - _Boundary: Public SDK DTOs + `internal/core/auth` ports_

- [ ] 1.2 Define auth decision and session-start event DTOs
  - Add non-secret event models in `pkg/lipsdk/auth` for auth decisions and session starts, including access mode, auth level, frontend identity, outcome, reason code, principal, device identity, and session certainty fields.
  - Define the core `EventSink` port in `internal/core/auth` (methods take SDK event DTOs) and `EventFailurePolicy` without durable storage or remote transport assumptions in the DTOs.
  - The event contracts make raw bearer tokens, API keys, SSO tokens, resume proofs, and personal OAuth tokens impossible to represent as first-class event fields.
  - _Requirements: 5.5, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7, 13.1, 13.2, 13.3_
  - _Boundary: Public SDK event DTOs + core `EventSink` port_

- [ ] 1.3 Define backend credential posture metadata
  - Add backend credential posture values for static credentials, workload credentials, OAuth-user credentials, and unknown classification.
  - Extend plugin registration metadata so backend factories can declare credential posture without exposing plugin-private configuration values.
  - Contract tests verify default or unknown posture behavior is explicit and visible to registry validation code.
  - _Requirements: 10.1, 10.2, 10.4, 10.5, 10.7, 11.5_
  - _Boundary: BackendSecurityProfile_

- [ ] 1.4 Add SDK contract documentation and compile-time guard tests
  - Document public auth and backend security contract intent, non-goals, and secret-handling expectations.
  - Add package-local tests or compile-time assertions proving the new SDK contracts can be consumed without internal packages.
  - The package boundary is verifiably stable: `pkg/lipsdk` does not import concrete core, stdhttp, provider SDK, or enterprise implementation packages.
  - _Requirements: 7.6, 10.2, 12.5, 13.1, 13.2_
  - _Boundary: Public SDK Contracts_

  - The config model can represent default single-user local-noop, multi-user local API-key, and remote-auth placeholder scenarios.

  - _Boundary: ConfigValidation_

- [ ] 2.2 Implement access mode normalization and listener classification
  - Normalize empty access mode to `single_user` and reject unknown mode values with clear validation errors.
  - Classify configured listener addresses as loopback, broad, non-loopback, or malformed for IPv4 and IPv6 cases.

- [ ] 2.3 Implement access/auth posture validation matrix
  - Validate single-user loopback-only binding, multi-user required authentication, and no-auth/noop restrictions.
