# Implementation Plan

Implementation is TDD-first and deletion-oriented. Every phase begins with characterization or architecture RED gates, converts all consumers to the canonical path, deletes an obsolete concept, and lowers the relevant budget. A task is complete only when its observable completion condition and named validation pass. No phase may be satisfied by moving unchanged logic between files.

## Phase 1: Freeze Behavior, Measure the Baseline, and Block Further Growth

- [ ] 1. Establish the contraction safety envelope

- [x] 1.1 Record exact architecture and behavior baselines
  - Run `make arch-report` at reviewed commit `efe4624909cea318c7211d5cb3734059d3210802` and record affected package/file non-test lines, fan-out/fan-in, exported public symbols, and current compatibility symbols.
  - Record repeated benchmark baselines for generation acquire/release, publish, dispatcher, candidate compilation, and successful/no-op reload using equivalent-host `benchstat`.
  - Inventory production and test callers of `Built`, `Build`, `RunWithRuntime`, `RequestPlane`, `requestPlaneAsBuilt`, `AttachReloadHost`, duplicate reload contracts, and deprecated public Options.
  - Observable completion: a committed baseline table names every old-path caller and provides reproducible metrics for Requirements 11 and 13.
  - _Requirements: 1.1-1.10, 11.1-11.9, 13.1-13.10_
  - _Boundary: Architecture, tests, and docs_
  - _Depends: none_
  - _Validation: `make arch-report && make bench`_

- [x] 1.2 Add critical-file freeze budgets for current hotspots (P)
  - Add budgets for reload coordinator, generation state, candidate compilation, process runtime construction, and public runtime build/facade.
  - Set initial ceilings to current measured values with no growth headroom beyond formatter variance.
  - Add comments containing final target ceilings and the phase that must lower each budget.
  - Observable completion: representative one-line growth in every hotspot fails `TestCriticalFileLineBudgets`.
  - _Requirements: 11.1-11.4_
  - _Boundary: Architecture tests_
  - _Depends: 1.1_
  - _Validation: `go test ./internal/archtest/... -run 'CriticalFile|LineComplexity'`_

- [ ] 1.3 Add behavior characterization matrix for deletion seams (P)
  - Map existing tests covering standard startup, legacy `Build`, generation startup, HTTP mounts, reload, public facade, validation, and shutdown.
  - Add only missing characterization for middleware/mount parity, partial bootstrap cleanup, public Close retry, capability reporting, and check-config non-public behavior.
  - Keep protocol, routing, streaming, auth, management, accounting, and provider behavior assertions unchanged.
  - Observable completion: every production legacy caller has a named behavior test or is proven dead before migration starts.
  - _Requirements: 1.1-1.10, 12.1-12.4, 13.1-13.5_
  - _Boundary: Tests_

- [ ] 1.4 Add RED architecture gates for final convergence
  - Add initially targeted tests for no production `requestPlaneAsBuilt`, no canonical-to-legacy runtime adapter, one reload contract declaration, one serve host builder, and one startup effective-load owner.
  - Keep gates scoped or allowlisted until their corresponding conversion task removes the current violation.
  - Prohibit new legacy path call sites immediately.
  - Observable completion: a synthetic new use of each forbidden pattern fails while the current known migration inventory remains explicit.
  - _Requirements: 3.1-3.10, 4.1-4.9, 7.1-7.8, 11.4, 12.5-12.6_

  - Run full race and bounded reload soak with goleak.
  - Run config/reload/lifecycle fuzz smoke and architecture scans.
  - Observable completion: all mandatory focused gates pass with no behavior waiver.
  - _Requirements: 1.1-1.10, 13.1-13.5, 13.9-13.10_
  - _Boundary: Tests and release validation_
  - _Depends: 9.3_
  - _Validation: `make test && make test-race && make test-fuzz && go test -tags=precommit -run '^TestRuntimeConfigReloadSoak$' -count=1 -v ./internal/stdhttp/...`_

- [ ] 9.5 Run benchmark/security gates and publish final release evidence
  - Compare repeated equivalent-host benchmarks with Phase 1 via `benchstat`.
  - Enforce the 10 percent candidate compile time/allocation threshold or obtain explicit evidence-based approval.
  - Run lint, module verification, govulncheck, marker scans, and architecture report.
  - Record exact commands, platform, Go version, base/final SHA, metrics, deletions, public API migration status, and known limitations.
  - Observable completion: final evidence demonstrates both behavior preservation and material maintainability improvement.
  - _Requirements: 13.1-13.10_
  - _Boundary: Release validation and docs_
  - _Depends: 9.4_
  - _Validation: `make bench && golangci-lint run --timeout=10m && go mod verify && go run golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest ./...`_
