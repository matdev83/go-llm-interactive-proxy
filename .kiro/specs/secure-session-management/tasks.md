  - Cover unbounded resume policy by proving sessions without a maximum resume window are not rejected solely because of inactivity age.

  - _Boundary: Runtime bundle_
  - _Depends: 3.2, 6.1_

- [x] 10.2 Wire durable stores and full recorder into runtime bundle
  - Open the SQLite secure-session store adapter when configured, append closers, replace the no-op recorder with the full app recorder, and enforce startup validation for durable/audit prerequisites.
  - Done when runtimebundle tests prove SQLite-enabled secure sessions build with durable storage and full recorder dependencies.
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 8.4, 9.2, 9.5_
  - _Boundary: Runtime bundle_
  - _Depends: 4.2, 7.6, 10.1_

- [x] 10.3 Update sample configuration and operator documentation
  - Document secure-session enablement, memory vs SQLite durability, resume window behavior, token key requirements, audit/redaction settings, diagnostics paths, and non-durable limitations.
  - Done when `config/config.yaml` and relevant docs show secure-session defaults and durable examples without implying continuity IDs are ownership proof.
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.4, 7.4, 11.5, 13.4_
  - _Boundary: Configuration documentation_
  - _Depends: 10.2_

- [x] 10.4 Add secure-session logs and metrics (P)
  - Emit structured logs and metrics for create, resume, denial categories, storage failures, mandatory audit failures, transcript append failures, and last-activity touch latency.
  - Redact token material and hash session/user identifiers where appropriate for logs.
  - Done when metrics/log tests verify denial category visibility without raw session authority leakage.
  - _Requirements: 3.5, 12.7, 13.5_
  - _Boundary: Observability_
  - _Depends: 6.3, 7.6_

- [x] 11. Add end-to-end integration coverage

- [x] 11.1 Test valid session create and resume across frontend, runtime, and backend stub
  - Add composed HTTP tests that create a session, capture proxy-issued resume metadata, resume as the same principal/workspace, and verify the same stored A-leg binding and session lineage are used.
  - Done when at least one frontend path proves create/resume works end-to-end with a stub backend and no raw resume token reaches the backend.
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.2, 5.1, 5.5, 6.2, 11.2, 13.4_
  - _Boundary: Cross-boundary integration_
  - _Depends: 8.2, 10.1_

- [x] 11.2 Test invalid, forged, and expired resume paths end-to-end
  - Add composed HTTP tests for missing principal, wrong owner, guessed A-leg, guessed continuity key, malformed token, expired resume window, workspace mismatch, and policy unavailable.
  - Done when every invalid path rejects before backend open and returns protocol-legal non-sensitive errors.
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4, 3.2, 3.3, 3.6, 6.4, 10.3, 11.6, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.6_
  - _Boundary: Cross-boundary integration_
  - _Depends: 11.1_

- [x] 11.3 Test durable restart and resume behavior end-to-end
  - Add SQLite-backed tests that create a session, close/reopen runtime storage, resume within the window, and reject when required secure-session ownership state is missing.
  - Done when restart tests prove owner binding, workspace, policy metadata, last activity, usage, and lineage visibility survive proxy restart.
  - _Requirements: 2.6, 6.7, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 10.7_
  - _Boundary: Cross-boundary integration_
  - _Depends: 11.1, 4.3, 10.2_

- [x] 11.4 Test streaming lineage, usage, audit, and recorder failure behavior
  - Add stream tests for pre-output B2BUA recovery, post-output committed failures, usage propagation, transcript ordering, audit redaction, per-attempt backend/model/status/accounting, mandatory pre-output readiness failure, and mandatory post-output recorder failure.
  - Split test cases by behavior cluster so lineage, attempt trace, usage, audit, and mandatory recorder failure assertions fail independently.
  - Done when stream tests prove no silent replacement after output and operators can identify surfaced vs swallowed attempts plus backend/model/status/accounting evidence in session records.
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 6.1, 6.3, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 9.2, 9.6, 10.8, 13.6_
  - _Boundary: Cross-boundary streaming integration_
  - _Depends: 7.6, 10.2, 8.7_

- [x] 12. Add performance, concurrency, and race validation

- [x] 12.1 Add memory store and generator race tests
  - Run high-concurrency create/resume/touch scenarios for the memory store and ID generator under the race detector.
  - Done when `go test -race ./internal/core/securesession` passes and proves no duplicated ids or data races.
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 1.6, 1.8_
  - _Boundary: Concurrency validation_
  - _Depends: 3.2, 5.1_

- [x] 12.2 Add recorder overhead benchmark smoke
  - Add benchmark smoke for stream event recording with transcript/usage/audit enabled and with capture disabled.
  - Done when benchmark output documents bounded overhead and no unbounded allocation growth for representative event streams.
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 6.3, 8.2, 9.1_
  - _Boundary: Performance validation_
  - _Depends: 7.6_

- [x] 12.3 Add SQLite concurrent resume and touch tests
  - Exercise concurrent resume, last-activity touch, attempt trace append/update, usage append, and transcript append against SQLite using deterministic fake clocks.
  - Done when SQLite tests prove transaction consistency, attempt updates remain attached to the correct B-leg, and last-activity state remains monotonic for accepted events.
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.5, 6.6, 7.2, 7.3, 7.7, 8.4, 9.4_
  - _Boundary: Durable concurrency validation_
  - _Depends: 4.3, 7.2_

- [x] 13. Final quality gates and traceability review

- [x] 13.1 Run focused secure-session test suite
  - Run all new package tests for `internal/core/securesession`, `internal/core/runtime`, `internal/core/diag`, frontend session tests, and SQLite store tests.
  - Done when focused tests pass and failures, if any, are fixed without weakening requirements.
  - Evidence: `go test -parallel=8 -timeout=10m` on `./internal/core/securesession/...`, `./internal/core/runtime/...`, `./internal/core/diag/...`, `./internal/plugins/frontends/openairesponses/...`, `./internal/plugins/frontends/sessionwire/...`, `./internal/plugins/frontends/parity/...`, `./internal/stdhttp/...` (green).
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1, 6.1, 7.1, 8.1, 9.1, 10.1, 11.1, 12.1, 13.1_
  - _Boundary: Verification_
  - _Depends: 11.4, 12.3, 8.6_

- [x] 13.2 Run architecture, precommit, and quality checks
  - Run architecture tests, precommit-tagged runtime/QA tests, and repository quality checks relevant to core package boundaries and config drift.
  - Done when checks prove secure-session core does not import concrete plugins/provider SDKs and config/docs remain tidy.
  - Evidence: `make quality-checks`, `make test-precommit-extra`, and full `make qa` (includes `go test -tags=precommit ./...`, `make lint`, `go tool govulncheck`) all green; lint fixes applied where `make qa` surfaced errcheck/gofumpt/paralleltest/modernize in secure-session tests and `execctx/submit_views.go`.
  - _Requirements: 7.5, 12.5_
  - _Boundary: Verification_
  - _Depends: 13.1_

- [x] 13.3 Complete requirement traceability and operator evidence review
  - Review `tasks.md`, tests, diagnostics, and docs to ensure every requirement id has implementation and validation coverage.
  - Done when all secure-session requirements are mapped to delivered code/tests and any residual limitations are documented for operators.
  - Evidence: Requirement groups R1–R14 remain mapped in `design.md` (Requirements Traceability table). Completed tasks in this file carry `_Requirements:_` tags through 12.x; Req. 13 (protocol-neutral feedback) and Req. 14 (operator visibility) are covered by frontend/session tests, `internal/core/securesession/adapters/diag`, `internal/stdhttp` diagnostics tests, and tasks 8.x/10.x/11.x. Residual: strict race coverage is Linux CI / `scripts/race-check.sh` (see `docs/release-gates.md`); Windows `make test-race` is intentionally a no-op. Wiring smoke: `go run ./cmd/lipstd` with `server.address: ":0"` reached `listening` (default `:8080` may already be in use locally).
