# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Establish the public principal/scope contract
- [x] 1.1 Add presence-aware safe attribution values and the authoritative scope snapshot
  - Represent unknown, known-empty, and known-populated attribution without overloading plain empty strings.
  - Include safe subject kind, principal identity, display label, auth method, credential identifier, roles, safe claims, tenant, organization, workspace, project, department, cost center, policy labels, and origin attribution.
  - Clone/copy behavior prevents callers from mutating roles, claims, labels, or nested attribution after receiving a view.
  - Done when package-local tests prove value semantics, clone isolation, field safety boundaries, and no raw credential/header fields exist in the public snapshot.
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 2.5, 2.6, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.6, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5_
  - _Boundary: SDK/public contract_
  - _Validation: go test ./pkg/lipsdk/scope_

- [x] 1.2 Add the legacy principal projection from the authoritative scope
  - Derive the existing principal identity view from the authoritative scope instead of duplicating identity mapping rules.
  - Preserve existing principal identity, display label, roles, and claim compatibility for current feature consumers.
  - Done when projection tests show scope wins over any separate principal-only input and existing principal consumers receive the same compatible fields.
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.5, 4.6, 7.3_
  - _Boundary: SDK/public contract_
  - _Validation: go test ./pkg/lipsdk/scope ./pkg/lipsdk/execview_

- [x] 2. Normalize trusted authentication into request scope
- [x] 2.1 Add trusted scope carriage to authentication results and audit evidence
  - Allow authentication decisions and transport-auth principal results to carry an optional safe scope supplied by trusted auth code.
  - Keep raw bearer tokens, API keys, OAuth tokens, resume tokens, and transport headers outside the auth result and event scope data.
  - Done when auth contract tests compile with both legacy principal-only decisions and richer scope decisions, and auth evidence includes only safe attribution.
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.5, 2.6, 5.2, 6.1, 7.1_
  - _Boundary: SDK/public contract_
  - _Depends: 1.1, 1.2_
  - _Validation: go test ./pkg/lipsdk/auth ./pkg/lipsdk/transport/httpauth_

- [x] 2.2 Build precedence and denial tests for scope normalization
  - Cover precedence in this order: trusted scope, principal projection from trusted scope, legacy principal fallback, then allowed local synthetic fallback.
  - Cover denied or challenged decisions so they produce safe decision evidence without creating a successful request lifecycle snapshot.
  - Cover missing optional tenant, project, department, and cost-center values so they remain unknown and do not change allow/deny outcomes.
  - Done when the focused tests fail against current principal-only behavior and describe the intended normalizer behavior.
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 1.6, 2.1, 2.2, 3.2, 3.5, 7.2, 8.5_
  - _Boundary: core/auth_
  - _Depends: 2.1_
  - _Validation: go test -run TestScope ./internal/core/auth_

- [x] 2.3 Implement trusted scope normalization and safety filtering
  - Normalize accepted auth decisions into one authoritative scope plus the derived legacy principal projection.
  - Preserve non-secret credential identifiers while omitting or rejecting unsafe attribution before execution begins.
  - Keep client-provided session, resume, or scope hints from elevating authority over trusted auth results.
  - Done when normalization tests pass and every returned principal view is derived from the returned scope snapshot.
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, 2.2, 2.5, 2.6, 3.2, 3.5, 5.4, 8.5_

  - _Depends: 2.2_
  - _Validation: go test ./internal/core/auth_

- [x] 2.4 Add operator-controlled local attribution configuration
  - Add optional local API key attribution for display label, auth method, credential id, tenant, organization, workspace, project, department, cost center, roles, safe claims, and policy labels.
  - Validate configured known values, roles, safe claim keys, and policy label keys at startup without changing raw key handling.
  - Done when config tests prove safe attribution is accepted, unsafe configured attribution is rejected, and missing optional fields remain unknown.
  - _Requirements: 2.5, 3.1, 3.2, 3.5, 5.4_
  - _Boundary: core/config_
  - _Depends: 2.3_
  - _Validation: go test ./internal/core/config_

- [x] 2.5 Map local API key and local no-auth requests to scope
  - Populate scope from validated local API key attribution while preserving non-secret credential identifiers and existing raw key behavior.
  - Mark allowed local no-auth requests as local single-user scope without inventing tenant, project, department, or cost-center values.
  - Done when local-auth tests prove configured API key attribution and local synthetic identity both produce safe scope snapshots.

- [x] 3.1 Bridge accepted HTTP auth decisions into request context
  - Attach both authoritative scope and the derived legacy principal projection for accepted requests before proxy execution begins.
  - Preserve current denial, challenge, and frontend response shapes for rejected requests.
  - Done when middleware tests prove accepted requests carry matching scope/principal views and rejected requests do not carry a successful lifecycle scope.

- [x] 3.2 Emit audit-safe authentication evidence with scope attribution
  - Include trace correlation, outcome, reason, and safe principal/scope attribution in auth decision evidence where available.

- [x] 4.1 Add scope to execution views with immutable copy semantics
  - Make the authoritative scope available alongside principal, session, attempt, workspace, and annotation views.
  - Keep lifecycle annotations separate from trusted attribution and copy maps/slices on insert and read.

- [x] 4.2 Resolve one scope before secure-session and backend execution
  - Read scope from trusted context when present, derive from legacy principal only when no scope exists, and create local synthetic scope only under existing local-mode conditions.
  - Pass only the principal and workspace fields secure-session needs, without making secure-session own the richer attribution model.
  - Done when runtime tests prove scope is present before backend work and secure-session receives a principal reference derived from the same scope.

  - Preserve current frontend request and response shapes while principal/scope attribution stays internal to the proxy.
  - Prove missing optional tenant, project, department, and cost-center attribution does not alter routing, secure-session eligibility, backend attempt selection, or non-streaming collection.
  - Done when focused compatibility tests pass for frontend shapes, missing optional scope, and streaming versus non-streaming scope consistency.

- [x] 6.2 Verify secret-safety across auth, session, usage, and traffic evidence
  - Prove bearer tokens, API keys, OAuth tokens, resume tokens, raw transport headers, and unsafe claim values never appear in safe scope, auth evidence, session evidence, usage events, or traffic observations.
  - Prove roles, safe claims, and policy labels are copied before exposure and cannot mutate authoritative request scope.
  - Done when security-focused tests pass across the edge, runtime, observer, and execution-view paths.

- [x] 6.3 Verify this remains attribution-only foundation work
  - Prove the feature does not add OAuth/SAML provisioning, billing, budgeting, rate limiting, allowance management, spend enforcement, redaction engines, dangerous-tool policy, policy decision engines, admin GUI flows, reporting charts, or cross-session search.
  - Prove principal/scope availability by itself does not change allow/deny outcomes when later enforcement features are absent.
  - Done when boundary tests and existing architecture checks pass without new provider-facing scope forwarding or new enforcement/admin surfaces.
