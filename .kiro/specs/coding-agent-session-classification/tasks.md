# Implementation Plan

## Execution Rules

- Execute against implementation-time current main, not the specification baseline blindly. Revalidate the session-preparation order, feature-plane census, large-body proof shape, and featurehost ownership before Task 1.
- Use TDD: create/refresh RED characterization tests before production behavior in each workstream.
- Keep this feature behavior-neutral for existing coding-oriented consumers. Do not gate #637/#467/#468/#469/#475 in this implementation.
- Do not add coding-client branches to generic core/runtime.
- Do not turn the new MetadataOnly plane into a hidden full-Call/content dependency.
- Remote TypeSafe/Jev tests are hermetic by default; live external tests are explicit opt-in only.
- Tasks marked (P) may proceed in parallel after their listed dependencies.

## Implementation Notes
- Task 4.2 requires immediate DB-parity catalog registration, a real feature-owned baseline migration, and SQLite/direct-PostgreSQL Load/Promote schema contracts: the mandatory architecture gate discovers the new dialect-sensitive package before Task 4.3. Task 4.3 retains Bun remote claim/completion and full remote-contract parity; no contract or gate is relaxed.

- General architecture LOC ceilings use maintainer-authorized fixed measurements with substantial headroom; file and tree audit tests retain exact ceiling and excess checks.

- Classification keying must use AuthoritativeSessionID or proxy-owned ALegID explicitly; generic SessionView.PartitionKey still permits ClientSessionHint fallback.

- The shared evidence matrix validates local source paths; update its active-spec references when Task 12.3 archives this SDD (and preserve explicit-completion source references if that spec relocates).

- Task 1.3 baseline absence assertions must evolve in Tasks 7.1/7.2 when bounded wire evidence lands. OpenResponses canonical User-Agent capture currently uses TrimSpace directly; use the shared acceptance helper for canonical/wire parity in Task 7.2.

- Task 4.3 uses one conservative precision rule across memory, SQLite, and PostgreSQL: lease and completion-based backoff deadlines round upward to the next microsecond, preserving aligned deadlines. Strict before/exact-deadline checks use the returned deadline; no adapter-specific tolerance or early expiry is permitted.

- Task 4.4 coalesced waiters preserve their own cancellation, then consult an available valid positive before propagating an owner storage error. Owner cancellation is tracked separately because Bun adapters return bounded store errors for mid-I/O cancellation.

- Task 5.1 initializes classification state only in enabled-generation lifecycle Start. The process owns two closers (terminal policy and the lightweight classification holder); generation Stop retains shared state. Initialization tracks owner cancellation separately so live waiters retry even when Bun returns a bounded schema error.

- Task 5.2 publishes the generation classifier through the exclusive PlaneSessionClassifier against the process-owned StateHolder; the remote decider is deliberately unwired so jev/hybrid fail open to unknown with zero egress until 8.3. TestClassifierHoldsNoNetworkCapableDependency pins the classifier to three fields and must be relaxed deliberately when 8.3 adds a decider. Add "sessionclassification" to archForbiddenFeatureTokens in 12.1 before any guarded aggregate gains an SDK-classifier field. Task 5.2 adds the classifier plane; evolve the lifecycle-only candidate assertions while preserving rollback and publication isolation.

- Task 5.3 gates the transition observation on first-positive OWNERSHIP (the store's promoted bool), not record positivity: a coalesced-flight waiter receives the winner's positive record with promoted=false and must record restored with no transition. TestClassifierHoldsNoNetworkCapableDependency permits 4 fields (cfg, state, now, observer) and TestPrometheusCollectorEmitsOneTransitionForConcurrentFirstPositive must stay non-flaky via the load-count handshake, not sleeps. Add a family-to-evidence-code totality test so ExcludedIdentity cannot misattribute for a future agentfacts family.

- Task 6.1 inserts a void runSessionClassificationStage call at executor_prepare_secure.go:548, after the runSecretGuardStage block and before captureFrontendIngressBeforeSubmit. Generic core reaches the plane only through the thin RequestRuntimeSnapshot.SessionClassifier delegate registered in plane_rules_tables AllowedStageConsumers. The evidence builder re-applies identity.AcceptClientUserAgent because internal/plugins/frontends/openresponses/decode.go:204,577 assign ClientUserAgent with a bare strings.TrimSpace and bypass canonical acceptance; openresponses needs its own repair ticket. The AST no-content-traversal guard is file-scoped, so keep the behavioral sentinel test as the load-beari

- Task 6.2 real gap was only session_start_view: emitSessionStartIfNeeded runs inside prepareSubmitAndALegSecure before projectContext re-derives views from preSession, so execctx/views.go mirrored an unclassified view into the SDK session key. Fix belongs in ViewsFromSecureSubmit, not the emit site. projectContext does a whole-struct views.Session = t.preSession and needs no change. TestSessionClassificationFieldHasNoExistingConsumer scans only runtime/execctx/pkg-lipsdk; internal/core/extensions/session_classification.go is the sanctioned generic-core seam that legitimately reads the field and invokes the classifier, and a repo-wide guard belongs to 12.1.

- Task 6.3 is tests-only. TestSameTurnOptInConsumerGatesOnFirstTurnPositive is a consumer-side proof of 4.2 that 6.1 already satisfied, not coverage of the 6.2 plumbing.

- Task 7.1 carries exactly one sessionclassification.Evidence field on Proof and WireSessionFacts; the largebody no-smuggling guard must reject unbounded storage at ANY depth (a []string nested one struct level inside Proof passes a top-level-only rule), and its container-exception ratchet must cover BOTH carriers. Every piece of 7.1 production code needs a test that fails when it is removed: aggregate-fact charging, both Proof.Validate branches, the WireSessionFacts.Validate branch, the WireTurnFacts operation check, and proof-to-wire propagation. Do not assert propagation by comparing two zero carriers before 7.2 populates them. Detached isolation must be proven by a state-count census that counts ACCEPTED rows (and deliberately over-counts no-op promotions), not a snapshot; injecting the stage into executor_prepare_detached.go fails all five detached tests. A canceled classification context cannot be driven through prepareRequest (secure-session resume fails first), so drive runSessionClassificationStage directly and discriminate with a live-context control. An established positive short-circuits before the cancellation guard, so a test combining both proves preservation, not cancellation. Each failing classifier in the persisted-positive matrix gets its OWN empty probe, so turn 2 always projects unknown; the load-bearing invariants are the byte-identical durable row and a weak-evidence healthy turn restoring it.

- Task 7.2 shares one acceptance policy via frontendpipe.CompileClassificationEvidence, which calls identitywire.CaptureClientUserAgent (itself delegating to identity.AcceptClientUserAgent) plus the shared ToolCategorySet.AddToolName accumulator; profiles read only tool.Name and never retain the ToolDef slice or header map. The differential fixture cannot import the unexported canonical builder (import cycle: frontendpipe -> stdhttp/contract -> core/runtime), so it mirrors it and pins the derivation inputs in source; canonical OUTPUT semantics are owned by internal/core/runtime's executor_session_classification tests. Always include a whitespace-padded User-Agent row: that is the only input class where openresponses' bare strings.TrimSpace capture is not trivially identical, and it pins the AcceptClientUserAgent idempotence the openresponses decoder deferral rests on.

- Task 7.3 inserts a second void stage runWireSessionClassificationStage in ExecuteLargeBody after prep.BindSession and before the route/ingress/authority consumers, calling the SAME extensions.RunSessionClassificationStage as the canonical lane. It imports no lipapi at all, which is the structural proof it cannot reconstruct a Call. The wire lane DOES resolve workspace (PrepareSecureSession runs snap.Workspace().Resolve for both lanes), so pass prep.Workspace(), never a zero view. The validated projection is deliberately discarded: every requirement-4.2 consumer is a canonical-required plane that statically blocks the wire lane, so boundSession.Classification has no reader. Its wireClassificationExecutor test helper MUST install a RequestCoordinator, or admitRequestAuthorityOnce never sets requestAuthorityFrom and the afterAuthority ordering assertion is a permanent tautology.
- Task 8.1 freezes the port as Decide(ctx, RemoteInput) (RemoteDecision, error) with RemoteDecision{CodingProbability, Confidence float64} and Positive(threshold) as the entire threshold policy; RemoteInput fields must be CLOSED named types, not strings, so an out-of-vocabulary value has no representation in the port. RemoteDecision cannot represent a negative (only the zero value is non-positive), which is what makes 6.9 monotonicity structural.
- Task 8.2 pins the LIVE vendor schema (fetched from https://docs.typesafe.ai/api at coding time, per the task's reconfirm-first rule): POST https://api.typesafe.ai/v1/systemone, Bearer auth, body {state, model:"jev-latest", questions:{<id>:{type:"noul",instructions}}}, response {model, answers, usage}. The adapter sends ONE noul question with an adapter-owned id the model never sees, and state carries exactly the six derived RemoteInput members as a structured object (the vendor docs explicitly support structured state).
- Task 8.3 wires the adapter by DEPENDENCY INJECTION, not a delegate: ClassifierDeps.Remote is the frozen 8.1 RemoteDecider port, filled by bindSessionClassifier from hostclassification.NewRemoteDecider(cfg), which returns (nil, nil) for heuristic BEFORE touching the adapter. The feature package never imports the adapter package, so there is no import cycle and generic core stays untouched.
- Task 9.1 certification tests live in the INTERNAL featurehost package (not featurehost_test) because the reload-must-not-erase-process-state claim is only observable as coordinator pointer identity through the unexported rt.sessionClassification field; process_lifecycle_internal_test.go sets the precedent. The reload test must stop EVERY live generation (baseline, heuristic, remote) before asserting, so the owner count actually reaches zero - otherwise a coordinator disposed only on the LAST Release slips past the composed layer entirely and is caught only by the lower-level holder unit test.
- classification_revision is NOT a per-promotion counter: both stores unconditionally rewrite proposal.Revision = 1 and only the FIRST accepted proposal becomes the stored positive (design.md:557 'normally moves from revision 0 to revision 1 once'). Requirement 2.6 requires replay NOT to advance it. Do not 'fix' this into a monotonic counter.
- Allocation ratchets MUST use fixtures whose normalization actually allocates. strings.ToLower has an allocation-free fast path for already-lowercase ASCII, so an all-lowercase padded sentinel let a size-proportional transcript scan allocate LESS than the small fixture and the size-invariance ratchet passed on a scanning implementation. Use mixed-case fixtures (uppercase on even indices) everywhere an allocation bound is the instrument, and say why in a comment.
- A row census alone CANNOT see a fixture whose declared evidence was never delivered. Task 10.1 shipped 28 rows where technical_prose/source_filename/code_fence/programming_language_name/model_name/prompt_compaction_marker all ran with the SAME generic 'summarize the diff' prompt, so 28 rows carried only 20 distinct signatures and 6 negatives certified nothing while logging PASS. Deliver fixture.WeakPrompt/ModelName on the turn, and add an evidence-aware census that rejects two distinct matrix rows delivered byte-identical evidence (build the signature from the ACTUAL delivered prompt via a single shared selector, never from the matrix declaration, or a delivery regression is invisible).
- The matrix's modelName cannot be delivered as a route/model field: the SDK classifier Input is deliberately model-free (requirement 3.4). The frozen weakPrompt already carries the model name in prose ('Would gpt-5-codex be suitable...'), so delivering weakPrompt satisfies the row.
- The canonical Input has NO model, route, or workspace-root field (only TraceID/Session/Workspace/Evidence), so a 'structural half' claim must reflect over the real SDK type. Declaring a LOCAL struct that mirrors it is a tautology.
- go test -overlay DOES reach //go:embed content (resolved at compile time); only runtime os.ReadFile tree scans - i.e. internal/archtest - are overlay-blind. A 'cannot overlay the embedded JSON' caveat is wrong and would push you to a weaker instrument.
- A SQL-verb census that only counts SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE silently reads a CTE form (WITH ... INSERT) as zero work. Record any classification-table statement whose verb is not counted into an `unclassified` ledger and assert it is empty, so a future dialect change fails loudly instead of weakening the zero-write result.
- Two warm-cache ratchets are layered and BOTH are needed: one pre-sets the projection so it short-circuits at the classifier seam, the other leaves the classification empty so it falls through to store.Load -> coordinator.load -> cachedPositiveLocked. Disabling only the coordinator Load short-circuit does NOT fire the classifier-seam test, and vice versa.
- measurement traps in hot-path work: (a) a reused *lipapi.Call across Execute calls is NOT a client turn (the executor mutates it), so later reuses resolve against a different authoritative session and legitimately read the store - build a fresh call per turn; (b) runtime.NumGoroutine is unusable at the composed layer because database/sql churns pool goroutines, so use a production-frame stack census attributed by spawning frame (it catches a leak whose own stack carries no classification frame).
- make test-cost is Windows-only and fails closed on POSIX by design. 9.3 added ~1.06s across four packages, inside the scripts/test-cost-budget.json budget (existing_delta_seconds 3,15s floor; internal/core/runtime has a 45s override).
- Convergence must be proven by CENSUSING EVERY RECORD THE STORE RETURNED TO ANY CALLER, not by checking final state: a last-write-wins store that ends at exactly one positive can still hand two callers two different snapshots, and only the census catches it.
- BunStore.CompleteRemote's AND kind = '' guard is UNREACHABLE through the Store API - claimRemoteSQL requires kind = '' and promoteSQL clears the lease token, so the token guard always rejects first. Verified by exhaustively enumerating 6250 op-orderings: the positive-and-leased row was reached 0 times. KEEP the guard as multi-writer table-boundary defense, and pin it with a raw-SQL construction because no API sequence can reach it. Without 9.2 that guard (and the neutral token guard) SURVIVED the entire pre-existing suite.
- A concurrency test that releases N positives and 1 negative from one barrier lets the positives win every time and measures nothing. The below-threshold negative must complete FIRST (genuinely accepted, writing into the row) and only then does the positive race start - deterministic, and it makes the negative's acceptance a fact rather than a coin flip. Reusing an exhausted attempt budget across phases silently makes phase 2 vacuous.
- Never claim a 'structural' or 'compile-time' proof using a LOCAL struct that mirrors a real type: it is a tautology, because adding a field to the real type changes nothing. Reflect over the real SDK type instead (TestLineageEvidenceCarriesNoRouteState).
- runRemote is claim -> Decide -> CompleteRemote as three SEPARATE store calls with the network between them. Coordinator.claimRemote releases c.mu before delegating and the remote pair stays out of the flight-coalescing path used by Load/Promote; MemoryStore drops its mutex around the nonce and re-checks on reacquire; BunStore uses single-statement NewRaw().Scan() with no RunInTx anywhere in the package. Lease TTL > timeout + RemoteLeaseSafetyMargin is validated ONCE in RemoteConfig.validate and deliberately not re-checked by the coordinator, so there is no second copy of that rule to drift.
- RetryBackoff and MaxAttemptsPerSession are now consumed by runRemote's loop (waitRemoteBackoff plus the loop bound), discharging the obligation 8.2 left open; the counter is STORE-BACKED and durable, so 17 turns and 12 concurrent claimants still observe exactly the budget in egress calls AND stored attempts. A retry fixture MUST use the process clock, not a fixed logical clock, because the store anchors backoff at the completion timestamp and a fixed clock can never release the deadline.
- Caller cancellation returns the cancellation to the caller and deliberately LEAVES THE LEASE TO EXPIRE instead of completing it with a canceled context (6.11 makes expiry the safe path for an abandoned lease). This is not a capacity leak: the attempt is already consumed pre-network, so reclamation is bounded by MaxAttemptsPerSession.
- Every bounded remote failure returns unknown with err == nil AND a completed lease; the sole non-fail-open remote outcome is a durable-state failure, which is wrapped in ErrStateUnavailable so a caller can tell 'the vendor said no' from 'we could not record the answer'. remoteProposal returns the zero proposal for anything not both valid and above threshold, and store-level guards forbid downgrading an existing positive, so no remote path can write a negative.
- 8.3 required a TEST-ONLY boundary exception: internal/core/runtime/executor_session_classification_{detached,failure}_test.go. Both changes are forced by the task's own criteria (a remote-capable classifier must now supply a decider, and the old test asserted 'no remote claim without a wired decider', which 8.3 makes false by design) and both strengthen assertions.
- CRITICAL vendor quirk: a noul answer carries NO confidence field - only Choice and Score answers do. So CodingProbability = noul and Confidence stays zero. Do NOT synthesize |2p-1| from the vendor's optional convenience formula: it is monotone in p, so any confidence gate on it would algebraically become p >= (1+c)/2, silently doubling the effective threshold and violating 6.8's "the configured positive_threshold alone decides promotion". Requirement 6.8 makes probability the only threshold input, so the zero confidence cannot block a promotion.
- readJevBody must NOT discard its read error. A hard timeout or caller cancellation fires while the body is streaming just as often as while headers are pending, and research.md notes Jev output generation is unbounded, so a fixed transport_failure message mislabels the DOMINANT timeout as remote_error instead of remote_timeout under 9.2/9.3. Always add a body-phase test cell that WriteHeader+Flush()es first, then stalls; the header-phase-only test cannot reach this.
- The vendor reference marks only usage itself as required; input_tokens/output_tokens are optional properties and research.md records Jev has no output-token charge. Model both as *int64 and require >=0 only when present, or every successful classification is refused and the feature silently disables while still failing open.
- RemoteConfig.RetryBackoff and MaxAttemptsPerSession are validated by 8.1 but UNCONSUMED after 8.2: the adapter deliberately makes exactly one HTTP attempt per Decide and surfaces 429/529 as a JevFailure kind. 8.3's coordinator loop MUST consume them, or 6.7's bounded retry is unsatisfied. Do not add internal retry to the adapter - MaxAttemptsPerSession is a per-SESSION counter a stateless per-call adapter cannot own, and internal retry would multiply real attempts past the budget.
- withJevEndpoint is unexported on purpose: it exists for hermetic httptest and must never be sourced from operator configuration, because an exported validated endpoint override permanently offers any in-repo caller a way to aim the bearer credential at an arbitrary https origin.
CRITICAL INSTRUMENT LESSON: go test -overlay is a SILENT NO-OP for internal/archtest tree-walking scanners because they use os.ReadFile (source_scan.go:191). Every archtest mutation proof must edit the real file, run, restore from a /tmp backup, and verify restoration by md5sum. For normally-compiled packages overlay works and is preferable.
Three archtest instrument lessons, all learned the hard way: (a) go test -overlay is a SILENT NO-OP for internal/archtest tree-walking scanners because they use os.ReadFile (source_scan.go:191) - any archtest mutation proof must edit the real file, run, then restore from a /tmp backup and verify by md5sum; (b) FileImportPaths discards ast.ImportSpec.Name, so a vendor rule built on it is ALIAS-BLIND - iterate file.Imports and check spec.Name.Name too; (c) a name-marker AND shape-marker rule plus a ://-only URL rule lets const authHeaderFormat = "Authorization: Bearer %s" through BOTH scanners, so the contract packages additionally reject any wire-shape marker and any brace-delimited quoted-member literal.
internal/archtest enforces a 500-line cap (rules_test.go:348); the vendor-scan fixture table pushed its file to 556, so the table went to a separate fixtures file rather than raising the gate. Widening the literal rule needed a narrow, %-verb-guarded exemption for the api_key_env credential-REFERENCE key that 8.3 obliges the contract to name - removing that exemption fails on 5 shipped config.go strings, which is the proof it is load-bearing.
Task 8.1 has NO production caller by design (8.2 consumes RemotePolicy.Config(), 8.3 consumes Positive/ValidateRemoteInput); 6.1 is currently satisfied by absence, since nothing constructs a decider so egress is structurally impossible. Port method-set pinning is by EQUALITY (interface kind, exactly one method, the name Decide, the frozen signature), not by a forbidden-name blacklist - a NumMethod+MethodByName guard already forces the name, so a forbidden-name loop beside it is dead code.
