# Implementation Plan

Implementation is TDD-first. Every production task follows RED → GREEN → refactor. No phase contains more than five tasks, and no task may enable backend-visible surrogate replay before Phase 6.

Hard ordering invariant:

```text
RED exact/disabled/privacy/bounds/source-compat contracts
-> canonical classifier + config + optional Poll + bounded store foundations
-> isolated compressor + egress + raw-result validation domain
-> original-first shadow submission
-> non-blocking shadow adoption
-> destination-gated active replay
-> certification
```

The completed reasoning-preservation, OpenAI Responses preservation, Codex native compaction, and compaction-continuity specifications are prerequisites/constraints, not implementation targets to rewrite.

## 1. Freeze Safety, Compatibility, Privacy, and Resource Contracts With RED Tests

- [x] 1.1 Freeze exact/native/signed/opaque non-compressibility
  - Add RED table tests covering OpenAI Responses exact items, Codex exact/native artifacts, Anthropic signed/redacted/opaque thinking, unknown dialects, and mixed exact-bearing parts.
  - Prove readable text inside an exact-bearing structure never makes it compressor input.
  - Prove compression-disabled behavior is byte/structure equivalent to current reasoning preservation.
  - _Boundary: feature domain / regression tests_
  - _Depends: none_
  - _Validation: `go test -count=1 ./internal/plugins/features/reasoningpreservation/...`_
  - _Requirements: 1, 2, 13_

- [x] 1.2 Freeze surfaced-winner/original-first lifecycle
  - Add RED tests proving compressor work is impossible for failed/cancelled/closed/replaced/gate-replaced streams, swallowed retries, and parallel losers.
  - Prove original `TurnArtifact` append precedes any reservation/provider submission on `success_released`.
  - Prove compressor failure cannot delete or invalidate a committed original.
  - _Boundary: response lifecycle / feature tests_
  - _Depends: none_
  - _Validation: focused reasoning-preservation observer/runtime tests_
  - _Requirements: 4_

- [x] 1.3 Freeze exported `BackgroundClient` source compatibility and optional poll semantics
  - Add a compile/source-compatibility fixture implementing only historical `SubmitCollect`, `Await`, and `Forget`; it must continue to satisfy `auxiliary.BackgroundClient` after this work.
  - Add RED contract tests for a separate optional `BackgroundPoller` capability with pending/completed/failed/not-found states and no blocking.
  - Cover Poll races with completion, Forget, expiry, and shutdown without changing Await semantics.
  - _Boundary: exported SDK / core auxiliary tests_
  - _Depends: none_
  - _Validation: `go test -count=1 ./pkg/lipsdk/auxiliary ./internal/core/auxreq`_
  - _Requirements: 6, 11, 13_

- [x] 1.4 Freeze optional-state per-session and aggregate memory safety
  - Add RED store tests for pending/session, pending/feature-instance, surrogate/turn, surrogate/session, and surrogate/feature-instance bounds.
  - Add multi-session tests proving aggregate exhaustion rejects optional state rather than evicting an authoritative original.
  - Prove delete/expiry/original eviction/stale cleanup decrement aggregate counters exactly once under concurrency.
  - _Boundary: feature store domain / concurrency tests_
  - _Depends: none_
  - _Validation: reasoning-preservation store tests with deterministic clock plus race test_
  - _Requirements: 3, 5, 13_

- [x] 1.5 Freeze ordinary-text privacy and raw-result allocation boundaries
  - Add RED tests showing semantic-text classification does not imply egress approval; cover allow/redact/deny/missing-policy/route-policy-mismatch.
  - Prove required redaction occurs before input budgeting and provider submission, and no unredacted sensitive source reaches the fake compressor.
  - Add oversized raw-response tests where JSON would be valid only beyond `max_output_bytes`; prove rejection occurs before JSON decode/materialization beyond the bound.
  - Distinguish trusted auxiliary control-plane metadata from model-visible `Call.Messages` in prompt-inspection tests.
  - _Boundary: privacy/security + parser allocation tests_
  - _Depends: none_
  - _Validation: focused feature/auxiliary/security tests_

  - _Validation: preparation/privacy tests_
  - _Requirements: 1, 2, 7, 8_

- [x] 3.3 Build one detached no-tools auxiliary compressor request per artifact
  - Require explicit configured route, private/detached execution, bounded output tokens, and `reasoning-output-preservation` disabled on the child.

  - _Requirements: 4, 6, 9, 11, 13_

## 5. Adopt Completed Results Non-Blocking While Still Replaying Originals

- [x] 5.1 Add one-shot non-blocking poll to the matching attempt path
  - For matching artifacts with pending state, use optional `BackgroundPoller` once; never Await or busy-wait.

  - _Requirements: 1, 12_

- [ ] 6.3 Gate surrogate use strictly on explicit active mode
  - Shadow remains original-only even with a valid surrogate.

  - _Validation: shadow-vs-active behavior tests_

  - Verify generic scheduler outer result cap plus feature `max_output_bytes` and decoded surrogate caps compose without redundant unbounded copies.
  - _Boundary: parser/performance_
  - _Depends: 3.4, 3.5, 5.2_
  - _Validation: fuzz + benchmark + allocation-sensitive tests_
  - _Requirements: 3, 10, 13_

- [ ] 7.5 Run repository gates, shadow-value review, and Kiro closeout
  - Run focused tests, `make quality-checks`, `make test-unit`, applicable parity/architecture/security checks, `go mod verify`, formatting/diff checks, and example-config/docs checks; run wider `make qa` when change surface warrants it.
  - Review a deterministic or approved shadow evidence set for savings, cost, privacy outcomes, raw-limit rejection, aggregate-budget rejection, and failure fallback; do not claim semantic quality improvement without separate task-quality evidence.
  - Revalidate this SDD against current `main` if request/terminal-pipeline simplification specs landed before implementation.
  - Update implementation ledger/spec status only after all required gates pass; keep active mode explicit and non-default.
  - _Boundary: repository/release/Kiro governance_
  - _Depends: 6.4, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4_
  - _Validation: repository gate suite + final diff/scope audit_
  - _Requirements: 13_

## Completion Gate

Implementation is complete only when all 32 tasks are green, exact/native continuity remains unchanged, `BackgroundClient` historical source compatibility is proven, ordinary reasoning egress is policy-controlled, raw responses are byte-bounded before decode, optional state is bounded both per session and across the feature instance, shadow evidence exists, and active semantic replay remains an explicit operator opt-in.

## Implementation Notes

- 1.4: Surrogate attach across policy revisions is REPLACEMENT with delta accounting (`cur-oldBytes+new`) on per-session and instance counters; `PendingCompression.SemanticDigest`/`EgressPolicyHash` correlation CAS is reserved for task 2.4.
- Host note: `go test -race` cannot run on this Windows worktree (cgo toolchain limitation); concurrency coverage is deterministic channels/sync + goleak, matching steering's Windows race skip.
