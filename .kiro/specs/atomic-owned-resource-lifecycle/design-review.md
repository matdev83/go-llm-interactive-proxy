# Brownfield Design Validation

## Verdict

**GO after scope hardening.** The design fits the current Go-LIP runtime and turns a Cordis-inspired idea into a small composition-root safety refactor rather than a new runtime paradigm. Three risks identified during validation were corrected in the final design: abstraction duplication, worker-helper overreach, and accidental cleanup-semantic merging.

## Critical Issues Found and Applied Corrections

### 1. Parallel lifecycle abstraction risk — RESOLVED

**Concern:** A generic `Owner`/effect framework could overlap `ResourceLedger` and `ProcessServices`, recreating the runtime duplication the project recently removed.  
**Impact:** Two cleanup authorities would make shutdown/reload reasoning harder and undermine the one-process/one-generation ownership model.  
**Correction:** The final design makes the process owner a private construction-time release stack only; generation resources continue to use `ResourceLedger` unchanged.  
**Traceability:** 1.1-1.6, 2.5-2.7, 5.1-5.4.  
**Evidence:** Design sections “Architecture Pattern & Boundary Map” and “Process Resource Owner”.

### 2. Generic worker framework risk — RESOLVED

**Concern:** Turning goroutine ownership into a general worker/scheduler API would add lifecycle concepts unrelated to the demonstrated gap.  
**Impact:** Higher cognitive load, unclear error/supervision semantics, and pressure to migrate unrelated goroutines.  
**Correction:** The helper is limited to existing generation-owned loops whose entire shutdown contract is cancel + join; model-registry refresh is the mandatory initial consumer.  
**Traceability:** 4.1-4.7, 6.2-6.3, 6.7.  
**Evidence:** Design section “Generation Loop Helper”.

### 3. Process/generation cleanup semantic collapse — RESOLVED

**Concern:** Sharing one generalized owner between process and generation resources could erase intentional differences: generation phases/retries versus host-owned process idempotency.  
**Impact:** Close-order regressions or a second shutdown state machine.  
**Correction:** Separate lifetime-specific mechanisms remain: private process release stack for construction ownership; existing `ResourceLedger` for generation phases. No cross-lifetime registration API is introduced.  
**Traceability:** 2.7, 3.6, 5.1-5.4.  
**Evidence:** Design sections “State and Ownership Model” and “Error Handling”.

## Validation Checklist

### Existing architecture alignment — PASS

The design stays under `internal/infra/runtimebundle`, preserves `ProcessServices`, immutable generation runtime, private host, reload contract, and manager-owned retirement. No domain/core package needs a new dependency.

### Core vs plugin ownership — PASS

This is composition-root infrastructure. Backend plugin contracts and external connector process supervision are explicitly unchanged.

### Canonical model neutrality — PASS

No `lipapi` request/event contract changes and no provider DTOs are introduced.

### Streaming and retry invariants — PASS

No request/stream execution code or retry decision path is changed. No-retry-after-output remains untouched.

### Lifecycle singularity — PASS

Generation resource phases remain exclusively `ResourceLedger`. Process shutdown remains exclusively host/`ProcessServices` owned.

### Type/interface scope — PASS

The ownership types are package-private, one-way release registration only. The design explicitly rejects `Get`, `Resolve`, `Provide`, keyed lookup, reflection, and container behavior.

### Concurrency — PASS with mandatory tests

The generation loop helper establishes ownership before releasing a start gate, then uses cancel + join on quiesce/rollback. Race/goleak coverage is mandatory.

### Error behavior — PASS

Existing aggregate cleanup and shutdown semantics are preserved. No public error category or wire mapping changes.

### Maintainability / simplification — PASS

The selected process builders stop returning closer lists to `NewProcessServices`; old caller-side plumbing must be deleted. Special explicit teardown remains explicit where abstraction would reduce clarity.

## Design Strengths

1. **The design is intentionally asymmetric.** Process ownership is improved where it is manual; `ResourceLedger` and backend cleanup are left alone because they already solve the problem well.
2. **There is an explicit kill switch for abstraction creep.** A migrated path must delete plumbing or establish a stronger invariant; otherwise it is reverted.

## Design-to-Requirement Trace

| Requirement | Validation result |
|---|---|
| 1 Preserve runtime model | PASS |
| 2 Atomic process ownership | PASS |
| 3 Eliminate closer propagation | PASS |
| 4 Structured generation loops | PASS with race/leak gate |
| 5 Preserve ledger/backend semantics | PASS |
| 6 TDD/simplification gates | PASS |

## Final Assessment

**GO.** The final design is implementation-ready as a focused brownfield refactor. The implementation must remain inside the frozen scope: private ownership primitives, selected ProcessServices closer-propagation removal, model-registry refresh loop ownership, and architecture/test ratchets. Any proposal for reactive dependencies, public lifecycle APIs, a generalized effect/container runtime, or `ResourceLedger` redesign requires a new spec.
