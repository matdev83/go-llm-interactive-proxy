# Versioned Runtime Reload — Release Evidence

**Recorded:** 2026-07-22T14:14:54Z

**Reviewed head:** `c5704359c1dfef10f26a8b191581e43e4e2b27d1`

**Platform:** Linux 6.17.0-1018-oracle x86_64

**Go:** go1.26.5 linux/amd64

**Reviewer:** Hermes (independent final validation after Cursor implementation/remediation)

## Acceptance result

All mandatory local release gates pass. The implementation satisfies the approved requirements and design boundaries for explicit transactional runtime reload, immutable request-plane generations, stable-listener publication, generation pinning, rollback, bounded retirement, management/signal administration, and public facade compatibility.

After PR review, management shutdown was bounded by the configured timeout. Independent cross-checking found and repaired the corresponding retry-state defect, then the full PR lint gate was cleared without suppressions. A load-sensitive failover fixture double-consume was exposed by the canonical race gate, repaired, stressed 5,000 times, and followed by a clean complete race rerun at the reviewed head.

## Soak parameters and assertions

`TestRuntimeConfigReloadSoak` is bounded and deterministic:

- 48 reload rounds;
- 4 concurrent data-plane workers;
- retained-generation budget of 2;
- one boot-generation SSE pin held throughout;
- 2-second coordinator timeout;
- mixed valid, invalid, no-op, restart-required, and retention-pressure triggers;
- asserts accepted traffic is not dropped, no unexpected status is returned, retained generations stay bounded, and goleak reports no owned leak.

## Reload-specific benchmark baseline

Fresh single-host results from `make bench` on AMD EPYC 9J14 (`GOMAXPROCS` selected 2 benchmark workers):

| Benchmark | Result | Memory |
|---|---:|---:|
| `BenchmarkManager_AcquireRelease-2` | 59.68 ns/op | 16 B/op, 1 alloc/op |
| `BenchmarkGenerationDispatcher_AcquireLease-2` | 1,074 ns/op | 784 B/op, 9 allocs/op |
| `BenchmarkManager_Publish-2` | 1,014 ns/op | 476 B/op, 4 allocs/op |
| `BenchmarkRetainedGenerationOverhead/n=1-2` | 38.92 ns/op | 0 B/op, 0 allocs/op |
| `BenchmarkRetainedGenerationOverhead/n=4-2` | 41.66 ns/op | 0 B/op, 0 allocs/op |
| `BenchmarkRetainedGenerationOverhead/n=16-2` | 53.12 ns/op | 0 B/op, 0 allocs/op |
| `BenchmarkRetainedGenerationOverhead/n=64-2` | 92.96 ns/op | 0 B/op, 0 allocs/op |
| `BenchmarkCandidateCompilation-2` | 9,085,490 ns/op | 4,591,539 B/op, 19,600 allocs/op |

These feature-specific benchmarks establish the initial comparison baseline. There is no equivalent pre-feature series, so this evidence does not claim statistical improvement from one run. Future changes must compare repeated samples on equivalent hardware and treat meaningful hot-path regressions as release blockers or document explicit acceptance.

## Platform coverage

- Linux/amd64 is the authoritative local execution platform for this record.
- Unix SIGHUP behavior and shutdown separation are covered by tagged command tests.
- Non-Unix API-only/build behavior is covered by platform-specific compile/contract tests in the full suites.
- HTTP/1.1 keep-alive, HTTP/2 multiplexing, SSE, cancellation, failover, parallel race, pre-output recovery, post-output no-retry, and management paths are covered by deterministic composed tests.

## Security and dependency review

- No watcher, polling, runtime plugin installation, or arbitrary source/path ingestion was added.
- `internal/core` driving-adapter import guards pass.
- Management source path remains startup-fixed; request bodies cannot supply YAML, paths, URLs, commands, or plugin instructions.
- Errors/status/telemetry remain bounded and secret-safe under corpus tests.
- The Go dependency delta is an indirect `golang.org/x/*` security-compatible update set centered on `x/text`; no new direct dependency was added.
- `govulncheck` reports no reachable vulnerability.

## Optional external gates not executed

The following are intentionally outside mandatory offline certification and were not used as release evidence:

- live Cursor SDK/API tests requiring `CURSOR_API_KEY`;
- live hosted-provider inference tests requiring external credentials and billable calls;
- external PostgreSQL/PgBouncer integration environments unrelated to this feature’s ownership/configuration changes;
- macOS and Windows native runtime execution (non-Unix behavior is compile/contract tested).

## Known limitations / explicit non-goals

- Editing or replacing the configuration file alone has no effect; an explicit SIGHUP or authenticated management API trigger is required.
- There is no file watcher, polling, debounce loop, automatic retry, plugin discovery rescan, download, or runtime installation.
- Runtime source reload depends on supported atomic-replacement identity semantics; unsupported filesystems/platforms report reload unavailable while startup serving remains possible.
- Listener/server topology, process services, plugin discovery/trust, global observability, store topology, and other startup-only fields return restart-required.
- Management is startup-fixed and opt-in by address; multi-user or non-loopback use requires dedicated strong authentication.
- Long-lived pinned work is not killed to reclaim a generation; retained-budget pressure rejects later publication safely.
- Fuzz evidence here is a 500 ms per-target smoke. Extended fuzzing remains a nightly/manual responsibility.
- Benchmark values are a first baseline, not a cross-host or statistically repeated regression comparison.
