# Implementation Plan

This plan is staged for a regression-sensitive brownfield codebase and for execution by agents that should **follow the plan rather than redesign it**. The canonical request path is the behavioral oracle. Do not improvise a simpler fast path, fabricate a partial `lipapi.Call`, or weaken an authority to keep wire mode.

Rebaseline used for this revision: `main` at `b08c60846a2a0119eeefef135cd6bbe06162a894` (2026-09-09). **Task 1 must still re-check the exact implementation-start SHA before production changes.**

Final V1 control flow:

```text
frontend-specific outer auth/media/path checks
  → cheap feature/profile/executor/known-length gates
  → O(1) frozen static disposition
       definitely canonical → unchanged canonical body read (NO spool/scanner)
       needs request facts  → continue
  → legacy full-body ResolveRouteSelector configured?
       yes → unchanged canonical path before capture
       no  → bounded capture + streaming shared JSON preflight
             → one existing byte-weighted DecodeAdmission permit
             → protocol semantic proof + RouteFromBodyModel parity
             → exact canonical semantic identity + recorder/session facts
             → AssessLargeBody (pure/frozen; SAME permit still held)
                  decline → canonical Spec.Decode under SAME permit → existing path
                  accept  → release permit → ONE-WAY WIRE COMMIT
             → ExecuteLargeBody
                  BeginTurn/A-leg exactly once
                  → live late route authority inside pre-certified domain
                  → existing authority/economic admission
                  → existing attempt/retry/recovery owner
                  → backend OpenWire from replay
                  → canonical EventStream + bounded ResponseFacts
                  → existing frontend wrap/write + keepalive/session carriers
```

There is no core-owned canonicalization callback, no second decode-admission decision, no provider-name switch in generic core, and no expected canonical fallback after wire commit.

## Execution Rules

- Characterization/TDD before each brownfield refactor.
- Keep implementation PRs chronological and focused. Do not implement Tasks 1–20 in one giant PR.
- Never fabricate a partial/minimal/shadow `lipapi.Call`.
- Never skip/reorder or post-hoc invoke a configured full-body `frontendpipe.Spec.ResolveRouteSelector`.
- Never run protocol semantic proof outside the existing byte-weighted decode admission.
- Never release/reacquire decode admission because proof/assessment declines.
- `AssessLargeBody` is bounded and side-effect-free: no `BeginTurn`, A-leg/store/DB read/write, billing/accounting reservation, provider I/O, client-body wait, spill read, or arbitrary unbounded plugin work.
- Static disposition is only a **fast reject**. It may say `definitely canonical` or `needs dynamic assessment`; it must never authorize wire execution.
- After assessment accepts and the permit is released, expected fallback is forbidden.
- Do not drop/reorder route candidates, disable races/fallbacks, or weaken authorities to retain wire mode.
- Backend exact/domain proof receives immutable profile body mode + rewrite semantics; `NeedsModelRewrite` cannot grant a rewrite the profile did not certify.
- Standard secure-session recording and metering need wire-native equivalents; do not make normal stock deployment permanently ineligible.
- Active Local Turn and Secret Guard execution are initial V1 blockers. Terminal Decision is also a blocker unless Task 12 explicitly closes continuation-source semantics.
- Preserve existing pre-request holdalive and stream keepalive semantics.
- First release remains default-off.
- If current code contradicts a task assumption, **stop that workstream, update the spec artifact first, then continue**. Do not guess.

## 1. Rebaseline Current Main and Freeze Canonical Oracles

- [ ] 1. Revalidate the exact implementation-start architecture before production changes

- [x] 1.1 Record implementation-start SHA and compare it with this revision
  - Record `git rev-parse HEAD` in implementation evidence.
  - Re-check frontend ingress/decode/admission, generated planes, request-generation binding, secure-session lifecycle, metering/accounting, routing/route override, backend contracts, keepalive/response ownership.
  - If any material seam differs from the assumptions below, update `requirements.md`, `design.md`, and this plan before production code.
  - _Validation: `git diff --check`; targeted architecture tests_
  - _Requirements: 22_

- [x] 1.2 Freeze frontend-specific outer ordering and shared pipe ordering
  - Characterize OpenAI Responses, OpenAI Chat, and OpenResponses separately.
  - Confirm current shared ordering: body read → header selector → optional whole-body resolver → shared preflight → `TryAdmit` → guarded `RouteFromBodyModel`/Decode → post-decode/traffic → execute.
  - Confirm OpenResponses auth + JSON media-type check stays in the outer handler before `frontendpipe`.
  - Characterize method/path/auth/content-type error/status precedence so the candidate lane cannot reorder errors.
  - _Validation: `go test -race ./internal/plugins/frontends/frontendpipe/... ./internal/plugins/frontends/openairesponses/... ./internal/plugins/frontends/openailegacy/... ./internal/plugins/frontends/openresponses/...`_

- [x] 1.3 Freeze request-body limits, gzip, decode admission, and route-selector precedence
  - Exact limit and limit+1; chunked/known length; cancellation; gzip canonical behavior.
  - Header selector wins as today; `RouteFromBodyModel` runs only when selector remains empty and while decode permit is held.
  - Full-body resolver, when configured, runs before shared JSON preflight.
  - Characterize decode admission weight/saturation/overweight/cancel/panic-release and `Retry-After` mapping.
  - Add fixture proving the current canonical path applies at most one `TryAdmit` decision per considered request, including terminal `Spec.Decode` failure; true proof/assessment-decline same-permit fallback is owned by Tasks 7.6/11.9, not this task.
  - _Validation: `go test -race ./internal/plugins/frontends/decodeqos/... ./internal/plugins/frontends/reqbody/... ./internal/plugins/frontends/frontendpipe/...`_
  - _Requirements: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 13_

  - Characterize `GenerationDispatcher` request lease and generation-scoped frontend executor wiring.
  - Add reload-race fixture proving one HTTP request cannot assess against generation N and execute/fallback against generation N+1.

  - _Requirements: 1, 5, 6_

- [x] 1.5 Freeze secure-session/A-leg/route-override lifecycle
  - Count principal/scope/session-open/workspace stages, `BeginTurn`, A-leg create/fetch, route-override snapshot/barrier, secure client-turn recorder, B-legs, terminal/finalization, new-session resume-token return, resume/denial/cancel/error paths.

  - OpenAI Chat: completion ID/timestamp/model/session headers.
  - OpenResponses: `AfterDecode`, `prepareCreateState`, store/continuation, wrappers/options/recorder.
  - Characterize `PreRequestKeepalive`/`holdalive.Wait` and `StreamKeepaliveInterval` context behavior for enabled/disabled/slow-open cases.
  - _Requirements: 17, 18_

- [x] 1.7 Freeze deterministic request/economic identity
  - Characterize `diag.StableCallID`, `StableCallToken`, `StableUnix`, explicit Call.ID precedence, metering checkpoint/fact/source IDs, billing call IDs, trace IDs, response IDs/timestamps.

  - _Requirements: 15, 16, 18_

- [x] 1.8 Build current Call/authority dependency census
  - Do **not** search only historical `preparedRequest.call`.
  - Trace all production `lipapi.Call` reads/retention and `lipapi.CloneCall` sites reachable from accepted request execution: `prep.call`, identity ingress/backend/conversation baselines, receive-turn facts, terminal evidence, attempt derivation/clamp preview, continuation/interleaved, metering/accounting, billing callbacks, local turn, secret guard, terminal decision, traffic, prompt-cache/compaction, response helpers.
  - Inventory current narrow ports from `executor_config.go`: prompt-cache maintenance; conversation reader/tagger/observer/steering; terminal policy; interleaved; compaction; request token estimator; routing/capability/eligibility; route override; secure-session recorder; accounting; billing; traffic; custom Call callbacks.
  - Classify every entry: `bounded wire fact/view`, `source/digest contract`, `response-only`, or `pre-assessment blocker`.
  - Produce a checked-in evidence table used by Tasks 3, 11, 12, and 19.
  - _Requirements: 5, 13, 14, 15, 19, 22_

- [ ] 2. Add zero-behavior-change plumbing only

- [x] 2.1 Add `server.large_payload_fast_path` configuration
  - Fields: `enabled`, `threshold_bytes`, `memory_spool_bytes`, `max_inflight_spool_bytes`, `max_semantic_fact_bytes`, `spool_dir`.

- [x] 3.6 Add constant-time static pre-capture disposition
  - Expose only `DefinitelyCanonical` vs `NeedsRequestAssessment` + bounded reason enum.
  - Static disposition **never** says “wire eligible.”

  - _Requirements: 1, 5, 21_

- [x] 3.7 Add static-disposition ratchets/benchmarks now
  - Tests for Local Turn, Secret Guard, unclassified plane, canonical-only traffic, missing two-phase executor, and a normal potentially eligible generation.
  - Benchmark definitely-ineligible candidate against feature-disabled canonical baseline: no temp file/replay/scanner and negligible overhead.

## 4. Replay Capture, Reservation, and Resource Safety

- [ ] 4. Build replay independently of protocol/routing logic

  - Under permit, replay source through protocol proof: selector/default, semantic subset validation, `ClientTurnShape`, `SessionInput`, body/rewrite facts, canonical semantic identity.
  - Legacy full-body route resolver is **not** invoked here; it was a pre-capture canonical gate.
  - _Requirements: 4, 6, 13, 14, 16, 17_

- [x] 7.6 Canonical proof decline under SAME permit
  - Proof decline owns same-permit fallback: materialize/decode from replay with existing `Spec.Decode` while the original admission permit remains held, with no release/reacquire and no second `TryAdmit`/429/503 decision.
  - Release only at today's post-decode boundary and continue normal Validate/AfterDecode/traffic/Execute.
  - Add decode-admission saturation race test proving no second 429/503 decision.

  - Core remains retry owner; prevent hidden SDK retry from creating different attempt economics.
  - _Requirements: 10, 12_

- [x] 8.5 Enforce outbound framing/header security

## 9. Secure-Session Wire Views and Sensitive Response Carrier

- [ ] 9. Keep stock secure-session behavior eligible without prompt materialization

- [x] 9.1 Build exact bounded `SessionInput`
  - Preserve current header/body/session/resume/client-session precedence.

- [x] 9.2 Refactor fact-based secure-session preparation shared by canonical/wire paths
  - Preserve principal/scope/session opener/workspace/new/resume/denial semantics.

  - _Requirements: 14, 18, 22_

---

## 10. Wire-Native Metering, Counting, Accounting, and Billing

- [ ] 10. Economic correctness must not re-materialize the request

- [ ] 10.1 Add wire-native frontend-ingress checkpoint

  - No hidden Call retained for retry/rerate.
  - _Requirements: 10, 15, 19_

- [ ] 10.3 Prove no-accounting + standard metering path first
  - With token accounting/preflight disabled, normal secure-session + metering composition must reach wire mode.
  - Do this before adding optional wire token counter complexity.
  - _Requirements: 15, 21_

- [ ] 10.4 Add exact wire token counting only where support is real
  - If accounting/context preflight requires tokens and only `CountCall` exists, dynamic assessment declines under same permit.
  - `WireCounter`/equivalent may scan replay only when exact profile/tokenizer semantics exist **before commit**; do not substitute bytes.
  - Keep permit-hold CPU bounded and measured; if exact counting is expensive/unbounded, leave that composition canonical.

- [ ] 11. This is the last expected fallback point

- [ ] 11.1 Implement optional internal assessor/executor interface

  - _Requirements: 6, 22_

- [ ] 11.2 Add side-effect sentinels before real logic

  - Measure assessment duration under held decode permit.
  - _Requirements: 6, 21, 22_

- [ ] 11.3 Consume frozen authority summary + current dependency census

  - Re-check static summary defensively; do not redo hot-path reflection/census.
  - _Requirements: 5, 13, 14, 15, 19_

- [ ] 11.4 Prove exact initial route candidate set
  - Reuse current alias/default backend/execution composition/native model rules.
  - Preserve sequential/fallback/weighted/race candidate order and membership exactly.
  - Do not prune incompatible candidates: any possible incompatible candidate declines the whole wire request.
  - _Requirements: 7, 8, 10_

- [ ] 11.5 Build late route-override compatibility envelope
  - Do not block merely because `RouteOverrideReader` exists.
  - Use the same generation validator/known backend/execution policy to derive all legal outcomes **without reading the live store**.
  - Unbounded override model domain needs backend universal proof such as `AnyAcceptedModel`; otherwise decline.
  - _Requirements: 7, 8_

- [ ] 11.6 Handle other late selector authorities conservatively
  - Full-Call route hints/selector mutators are blockers unless explicit bounded route-domain contract.
  - Separate from frontend legacy full-body resolver, already gated before capture.
  - _Requirements: 5, 7, 13, 19_

- [ ] 11.7 Prove exact + domain backend wire support
  - Pass immutable body/rewrite facts to every resolver.

  - Test homogeneous same-wire vs heterogeneous incompatible domains and actual post-BeginTurn override changes inside accepted domain.
  - _Requirements: 7, 8, 9, 21_

- [ ] 11.8 Bind and validate assessment stamp
  - Stamp binds generation identity, profile/proof identity, source digest/size, body mode/rewrite contract, candidate/domain proof generation.
  - Execute disagreement => invariant failure, never canonical fallback.
  - _Requirements: 6, 8_

- [ ] 11.9 Call assessment while SAME decode permit remains held
  - Assessment decline owns same-permit fallback: canonical `Spec.Decode` from replay under the original permit still held, with no release/reacquire and no second `TryAdmit`/429/503 decision (proof-decline fallback is owned by Task 7.6 under the same rule).
  - Accept => release once then commit.
  - Saturation/concurrency tests prove no fallback-induced second admission decision.
  - _Requirements: 1, 6_

- [ ] 12. Accepted wire execution cannot enter prompt-scale Call/CloneCall machinery

- [ ] 12.1 Convert Task 1.8 inventory into explicit bounded runtime wire facts
  - Only facts with named consumers; no shadow Call schema.
  - Route/protocol/max-output/identity/session/source/rewrite/economic facts as required.
  - _Requirements: 19_

  - Content-dependent estimator/requirement without exact source contract => blocker.
  - _Requirements: 7, 8, 19_

- [ ] 12.3 Refactor receive/terminal/conversation/continuation/interleaved/compaction dependencies conservatively

  - _Requirements: 13, 19_

- [ ] 12.4 Keep Local Turn and Secret Guard canonical in V1
  - Do not attempt to make them wire-safe incidentally while closing generic dependencies.
  - Their occupied planes remain static blockers.
  - _Requirements: 5, 13, 19_

- [ ] 12.5 Terminal Decision: either block or implement complete source/continuation parity
  - Default/simple implementation: occupied plane remains canonical blocker.
  - If implementation chooses to support it, it must prove bounded terminal evidence **and** continuation reconstruction from approved source/bounded facts, with full differential tests. Do not support only `DecisionStop` while silently changing potential `DecisionContinue` semantics unless provider capability is statically constrained to stop-only and certified.
  - _Requirements: 5, 13, 19_

- [ ] 12.6 Replace stale textual ratchet with real architecture boundary
  - Wire post-commit packages/functions must not accept/dereference `lipapi.Call`, `*lipapi.Call`, or invoke `lipapi.CloneCall` except explicitly whitelisted response-only adapters.
  - Catch `prep.call`, ingress/baseline/terminal clones and future renames through type/import/dataflow-oriented tests, not grep for `preparedRequest.call`.
  - Frontend candidate code cannot materialize a second whole body solely for legacy route resolver.

  - Each attempt opens source at zero and applies only approved candidate model splice.
  - Backend parser returns canonical EventStream.
  - _Requirements: 8, 9, 10, 12, 15_

- [ ] 13.3 Retry/race/cancel/invariant tests
  - Attempt1 pre-output failure → attempt2 gets complete exact bytes.
  - Parallel readers independent.
  - No failover after first visible event.
  - Cancellation closes readers/source and preserves lifecycle/economic cleanup.
  - Unexpected post-commit content need finalizes one turn and never invokes ordinary `Execute`.
  - Actual route override inside domain executes; outside-domain mismatch is invariant failure (should be unreachable after stamp/domain proof).

  - Sensitive token never reaches general logging/metrics/debug.
  - _Requirements: 14, 18, 22_

- [ ] 14.4 Preserve `PreRequestKeepalive` and `StreamKeepaliveInterval`
  - Streaming `ExecuteLargeBody` is invoked through same holdalive semantics as current streaming `Execute`.

  - No holdalive/provider bytes before validation + assessment + one-way commit.
  - Differential tests: enabled/disabled, long assessment, long provider-open, cancellation.
  - _Requirements: 1, 18_

- [ ] 17. Do not treat default OpenResponses create as stateless

- [ ] 17.1 Characterize/refactor only bounded no-store frontend state

  - Missing `store` stays canonical because current decode defaults true.
  - Preserve outer auth + JSON content-type ordering.
  - Prove no `AfterDecode` side effect/error moved after commit.
  - _Requirements: 1, 17, 18_

- [ ] 17.2 Implement no-store OpenResponses proof + compatible backend wire support

  - Compare to Task 1.10 current-main baseline.
  - _Requirements: 6, 21_

- [ ] 19.3 Enforce accepted-lane no-payload-heap invariant

  - Retained request heap bounded by memory spool + semantic fact budget + fixed buffers/metadata.
  - Size-scaling 1 MiB → 5 MiB → 20 MiB must be approximately flat/bounded; material body-proportional slope = failed optimization gate unless removed.

  - _Requirements: 5, 7, 13, 14, 15, 21_

- [ ] 19.7 ROI decision per lane
  - Report CPU/file-I/O tradeoff separately from heap savings.

## Implementation Notes

- Task 1.1 at `3da34d7875443355d65cb9d7df649555dfad3edb` has unchanged runtime seams vs `b08c608` baseline but full archtest and focused billing docs test failed at that SHA due to upstream `product.md`/`structure.md` marker removal; evidence `evidence/1.1-rebaseline.md`; no downstream workaround or production changes. Repaired by `caa38dc9` (cherry-pick of upstream fix `a640123c` restoring billing-exposure contract markers); `go test -count=1 -timeout=10m ./internal/archtest` now passes on the feature worktree.
- Task 1.2 test-only scope VERIFIED (independent reviewer APPROVED): fresh `go test -count=1` PASS exit 0 for 4 frontend packages (`frontendpipe`, `openairesponses`, `openailegacy`, `openresponses`); gofmt and diff check clean. Windows `go test -race` for same packages failed on `cgo.exe` exit 2 (Windows race/cgo toolchain limitation, not a test failure); future race certification needs working toolchain.
- Task 1.3 approved correction applied: 1.3 characterizes current canonical one-`TryAdmit` decision including terminal decode failure; Task 7.6 owns proof-decline same-permit fallback and Task 11.9 owns assessment-decline same-permit fallback with the original permit held and no second decision; Requirement 6.3 preserved.

- Task 2.1 VERIFIED (fresh reviewer APPROVED): six-field default-off `server.large_payload_fast_path` config with validation + invalid-reload last-good preservation; `MaxRequestBodyBytes` untouched; config package + archtest PASS, vet/gofmt/diff-check clean; budgets.go bump justified per procedure; `-race` skipped Windows cgo limitation.
- Task 2.2 VERIFIED (fresh reviewer APPROVED): `internal/core/largebody` provider-neutral DTO seam (bounded/immutable/redacted, no Call mirror, no SDK/frontend imports, no prompt/path/header-bag/unbounded maps); core ownership + budget ratchets PASS; largebody 17/17 + focused archtest PASS, vet/gofmt/diff-check clean; full archtest 18.8s implementer-claimed, focused subsets re-verified; no consumers yet; `-race` skipped Windows cgo limitation.

- Task 3.3 VERIFIED (fresh reviewer APPROVED): Bus 4-chain freeze (submit/request-part/tool/request-mutating blockers unless explicit wire contract, response-only proof with no request content dependency, no plane conflation); hooks suite PASS, gofmt/diff-check clean; test-only scope, no production diff; `-race` skipped Windows cgo limitation.
- Task 3.4 VERIFIED (fresh reviewer APPROVED): 46-row narrow-port freeze from Task 1.8 inventory (stock no-op vs blocker vs wire-capable states, custom Call callbacks blockers unless explicit bounded fact contract, no reflection/arbitrary invocation); runtime suite PASS, vet/gofmt/diff-check clean; test-only scope, no production diff; `-race` skipped Windows cgo limitation.
- Task 3.5 VERIFIED (fresh reviewer APPROVED): WireEligibilitySummary composition-time/deterministic/pinned/bounded/fail-closed, fixed bitsets/enums, no request-sized data, budgets bump; largebody + feature + archtest PASS, vet/gofmt/diff-check clean; `-race` skipped Windows cgo limitation.
