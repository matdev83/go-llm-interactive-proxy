- [x] 9. Implement the frontend protocol plugins
  - **Emulator-first:** For each client-facing API flavor, deliver a **reference client emulator** (task 9.0.x) before the matching proxy `frontends/*` plugin (task 9.x). The emulator is the scriptable, spec-shaped client used in end-to-end integration tests; implementing agents must not treat the real proxy frontend as the first proof of wire compliance.
  - **Multimodal:** Every bundled frontend must correctly handle **multimodal** requests and responses on the v1 shared subset (e.g. images, PDFs); reference client emulators must support scripted multimodal scenarios for integration tests (see Requirement 15.7).
  - For each frontend plugin, write RED protocol contract tests before implementation, then implement decode/encode against the canonical model and event stream.
  - **Subset documentation:** The v1 per-protocol decode/encode surface is summarized under **Requirement 3 → Implementation notes (2026-04-21)** in `requirements.md`, with normative links and deeper matrix text in `research.md` (*Frontend subset vs spec* bullets, 2026-04-21 refresh).

  - _Boundary: frontends/*, internal/testkit (reference emulators)_
  - _Depends: 2, 3, 4, 7_

- [x] 9.0 Build reference **client** emulators (official libraries, spec-faithful)
  - For each supported **frontend** protocol, add a scriptable **reference client** built on the **official vendor client library** for that API (not hand-rolled HTTP sketches). It issues requests and consumes responses/events exactly as a real client would per published API docs, so later E2E runs can point it at `lipstd` and assert compliance.
  - Include **multimodal** scenarios: at least one **image** and one **document (e.g. PDF)** flow per protocol where the official API supports that modality, so tests can verify proxy multimodal handling end-to-end.
  - Cross-check each emulator against the official specification (documented matrix: endpoints, auth headers, streaming modes, error shapes, idempotency where relevant). Do not start the matching proxy frontend plugin until this review is complete.
  - _Normative API URLs: `research.md` → **Official API specification references (normative docs)**._
  - _Requirements: 3.1–3.4, 15.2, 15.3, 15.7_

  - _Depends: 9.0.4, 7_

- [x] 10. Implement the backend protocol plugins
  - **Emulator-first:** For each **remote backend connector** protocol the proxy speaks as a client to the remote inference backends, deliver a **reference remote backend emulator** (task 10.0.x) before the matching `backends/*` connector. The emulator is a spec-faithful fake provider (scriptable, deterministic) used in E2E tests; do not use the first implementation of `backends/*` as the only validation of wire behavior.
  - **Multimodal:** Every bundled backend connector must correctly map **multimodal** canonical parts to provider APIs and back; reference backend emulators must accept and emit multimodal content for tests (see Requirement 15.8).
  - For each backend, write RED adapter tests; implement provider calls through official SDKs or official protocol definitions where available.

- [x] 10.0 Build reference **remote backend** emulators (official libraries, spec-faithful)
  - For each supported **backend connector** protocol, add a **reference server or stub service** that speaks the provider API on the wire as defined in official docs. Prefer **official server-side or SDK-hosted test doubles** where the vendor documents them; otherwise implement minimal HTTP/gRPC handlers using official request/response types from the vendor SDK so payloads stay spec-aligned.
  - Support **multimodal** request and response fixtures: at least one **image** and one **document** path per protocol where the API allows, so the proxy’s outbound multimodal mapping is testable without a live provider.
  - Cross-check each emulator against the official specification (streaming event sequences, error models, auth expectations). Do not start the matching proxy backend connector until this review is complete.

- [x] 12.3 Implement multimodal conformance matrix rows
  - For every multimodal-capable frontend × multimodal-capable backend pair: image input round-trip and document (PDF) input round-trip, verifying canonical part preservation (no content-type confusion, no silent truncation). Explicitly list pairs where multimodal is not viable with justification.
  - _Requirements: 2.6, 2.7, 3.7, 3.8, 4.8, 15.9_
  - _Boundary: internal/testkit/conformance, all protocol plugins_
  - _Depends: 12.1_

- [x] 12.4 Derive migration fixtures from the Python repository
  - Import or derive streaming and non-streaming captures from the Python repo for at minimum the OpenAI Responses protocol pair and at least one additional protocol pair where practical. Add golden files to `testdata/` with documented provenance (source repo commit, endpoint, streaming mode).
  - _Requirements: 15.5, 15.13_
  - _Boundary: testdata/, internal/testkit/conformance_
  - _Depends: 12.1_

- [x] 12.5 Define and enforce release gates
  - Document the quantitative release-readiness criteria: conformance matrix pass percentage, race-detector gate, critical fuzz target list (selector parser, protocol decoders, canonical mutation validators), and minimum migration fixture count.
  - Wire gates into CI so that merging to main requires them to be green.
  - _Requirements: 15.4, 15.6, 14.6_
  - _Boundary: CI, internal/testkit_
  - _Depends: 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4_

- [x] 13. Sanity checks

  - [x] 13.1. Each of the front-end connectors has integration tests made by using of the front-end API emulator/client.

  - [x] 13.2. Each of the back-end connectors has integration tests made by using of the remote back-end emulator.

  - [x] 13.3. Each combination of front-end and back-end has integration tests made by using of the client emulator on the client side and remote backend emulator on the backend side.

- [x] 14. Go reimplementation v1 stage checklist
  - _Evidence: Tasks 9–13 + 12 conformance matrix; `internal/testkit/conformance/stage_checklist_14_evidence_test.go` (integration + refclient file guards); B2BUA lineage assertions in `internal/core/runtime/executor_test.go`; composite routing parity in `internal/core/routing/parser_test.go` (`TestParseParity_pythonLIPCompositeSelector`); route query → `lipapi.GenerationOptions` via `pkg/lipapi/route_params.go` merged in `internal/core/runtime/executor.go` before `Backend.Open`._

  - [x] 14.1. Fully implemented proxy front-end API interfaces in most popular LLM API flavors: OpenAI Chat Completions, OpenAI Responses API, Anthropic Messages API, Gemini API. Each of those with full test coverages at level that we are able to **prove** API/protocol compliance/correnctness. This includes handling of multimodal inputs.

  - [x] 14.2. Fully implemented proxy back-end connector API interfaces in most popular LLM API flavors: OpenAI Chat Completions, OpenAI Responses API, Anthropic Messages API, Gemini API plus ACP Agent Client Protocol. Each of those with full test coverages at level that we are able to **prove** API/protocol compliance/correnctness. This includes handling of multimodal inputs.

  - [x] 14.3. Cross-API translations for any possible combination of (front-end API, back-end API), including extensive set of both unit and integration tests with full test coverages at level that we are able to **prove** each and every combination of APIs is properly translated at the proxy level.

  - [x] 14.4. B2BUA Functionality in proxy core. Our app properly following B2BUA-like semantics. One A-leg can have multiple, properly mapped B-legs.

  - [x] 14.5. Dynamic routing parity with `llm-interactive-proxy` Python counterparty, which includes: failover routing (separation of backends with pipe char), weighted routing (with "^" separator) and per-leg parameters support in square brackets, ie: "[first]openai-codex:gpt-5.3-codex?reasoning_effort=high^[weight=4]openai-codex:gpt-5.3-codex?reasoning_effort=low|[weight=2]openai-codex:gpt-5.3-codex?reasoning_effort=medium"

  - [x] 14.6. Model routing strings (parser) properly allow for URI-like params passing into the concrete backend connector, ie "gemini:gpt-5.2?reasoning_effort=high&temperature=0.2" which should pass reasoning effort and temperature settings to the be used to complete requests if such model route is used.
