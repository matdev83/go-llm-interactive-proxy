# Routing and Orchestration (Steering)

## Core Ownership Boundary

Core owns provider-neutral execution semantics:

- selector parsing and route-plan construction;
- model alias expansion and candidate resolution;
- health/exclusion filtering and attempt budgets;
- ordered failover, weighted choice, affinity, races, and time budgets;
- A-leg routing-override authority and turn-level snapshotting;
- B2BUA attempt sequencing, lineage, output commitment, and pre-output recovery;
- cancellation/terminal ownership and provider-neutral evidence flow;
- core execution-stage authority and control-plane projections.

Plugins may contribute policy inputs or optional behavior through SDK contracts. They do not become alternate owners of route planning, B2BUA sequencing, commitment, or retry/failover policy.

The parser and its tests are the source of truth for concrete selector syntax. Steering records semantics, not a token-by-token grammar copy.

## Routing Semantics

Regardless of concrete selector syntax, these rules are invariant:

- **Planning precedes execution**: aliases, overrides, capability checks, eligibility, and candidate shaping are resolved before opening a provider leg where possible.
- **Attempt-local state stays attempt-local**: candidate-specific capability downgrades, provider identity, timeouts, and evidence must not leak into sibling attempts.
- **Affinity is advisory policy, not hidden authority**: it may influence candidate choice but must not bypass capability/security/health rejection.
- **Runtime overrides are A-leg scoped**: changes affect later admitted turns, never mutate an in-flight turn or B-leg, and must be snapshotted before planning.
- **Reload is generation-based**: new configuration affects new admissions through a newly published immutable generation; in-flight turns keep their admitted generation/state.

## Output Commitment and Recovery

1. **Recovery is pre-output only** — transparent failover, retry, or race substitution is allowed only before client-visible canonical output commits an attempt.
2. **First visible content commits** — once an attempt has emitted client-visible content, later failure is terminal for that attempt; completed effects are not replayed.
3. **Every attempt is attributable** — each logical client turn and backend attempt has durable lineage/evidence according to the configured continuity mode.
4. **Race losers terminate cleanly** — losing or canceled attempts are canceled, drained only as needed for bounded terminal evidence, and terminalized exactly once.
5. **Provider-only evidence may survive cancellation** — bounded secret-safe terminal evidence can still feed accounting/diagnostics even when the attempt never commits output.

## Attempt Publication and Terminal Ownership

- Attempt publication is gated: an attempt is not visible to downstream reducers until its required readiness/initialization contract is complete.
- There is one physical terminal owner for an attempt. All teardown, observers, authority settlement, metering, lineage, billing evidence, and local state converge through that at-most-once terminal path.
- A-leg cancellation versus provider activation must be linearizable. Cancellation cannot leave an unowned provider stream or publish a half-initialized attempt.
- Transitional rollback/abort paths should not create a second terminal protocol.

## Generation Compilation and Publication

A runtime generation is an immutable request plane. Candidate compilation/validation and active publication are distinct phases.

- **Compilation must be side-effect isolated**: compiling or validating a candidate generation must not mutate active process feature state or externally visible generation state.
- **Candidate-owned resources use explicit ownership**: resources acquired during compilation belong to the candidate resource ledger and are released on rejection/rollback.
- **Publication-only effects run after publication**: any action that changes process-visible behavior because a generation became active must be registered for the publication phase and execute only after the generation is the active published request plane.
- **Rejected candidates are observationally inert**: a candidate that never publishes must not retarget process metrics, replace active services, or otherwise affect serving behavior.
- **Retirement is manager-owned**: superseded generations drain existing users and close through the generation lifecycle; request paths do not implement ad-hoc generation cleanup.

These rules apply to feature-host output, metrics projections, background workers, reload, and future generation-bound facilities.

## Core vs Feature Policy

Use the kernel/policy test when deciding ownership:

- If logic is required with all optional product features disabled and is necessary to coordinate execution safely, it may be core.
- If logic is optional UX, maintenance, reasoning shaping, safety policy, actor policy, or other feature behavior, the feature owns it and core consumes only a narrow typed port/plane.
- Pure projection/state-machine kernels over canonical facts may stay core when multiple features/protocols rely on the same invariant; mutable feature state and feature-specific policy stay outside core.

No request-time service locator or concrete-feature switch belongs in core/runtime composition.

## Billing Boundary

Routing/execution and billing cooperate through narrow lifecycle seams:

- a cheap financial eligibility screen may occur before expensive route expansion;
- route/quote evaluation remains side-effect-free;
- operational exposure is admitted atomically before upstream execution;
- terminal ownership appends immutable per-attempt/call usage evidence;
- customer settlement and provider cost posting happen after usage and are not stream-receive responsibilities.

Stream handlers must not rate prices, post journal entries, mutate balances/exposure, or use the legacy token ledger as monetary truth.

## Continuity and Persistence

Continuity implementations may be in-memory or durable, but semantics must remain backend-independent:

- A-leg/B-leg identity and ordering are authoritative product concepts, not database-row accidents.
- Persistence adapters must preserve the same contract across supported database engines.
- Pooler/topology restrictions belong to persistence/infrastructure policy, not routing logic.
- Feature-owned durable state must not turn the core continuity store into a generic feature database.

## Change Procedure

For routing/orchestration changes:

1. Identify whether the change affects parsing, planning, attempt lifecycle, commitment, cancellation, generation lifecycle, or optional feature policy.
2. Preserve single ownership: do not solve a feature problem by adding a second planner/terminal path.
3. Write focused characterization/regression tests before rewiring lifecycle code.
4. Exercise cancellation/race cases when concurrency changes.
5. Verify no retry/failover can occur after commitment.
6. Verify candidate-generation failure leaves active process/generation state unchanged when composition changes.
7. Run architecture and relevant contract/parity gates.

Concrete selector operators, feature names, provider inventories, and store implementations should be looked up in their executable packages/tests rather than duplicated here.
