package configreload

// Canonical reload vocabulary lives in pkg/lipsdk/configreload.
// This package owns stage constants plus policy/history/sanitization algorithms
// that are not part of the public contract. Consumers of trigger/result/status
// shapes import the SDK package directly.

// Stage names used in ReasonCategory / diagnostics (bounded, non-secret).
