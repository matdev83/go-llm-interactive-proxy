// Spec: b-leg-path-virtualization Task 8.2, the fail-closed half.
// Requirements 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, and 8.3.
//
// Design sections read for this file:
//
//   - "7. Path Expansion Finalizer" step 8 ("if reserved alias is malformed or carries
//     a different workspace tag/flavor/drive, reject with bounded reason") and step 10
//     (the assembler, not the pass, synthesizes what the client sees);
//   - "6. Mandatory Buffering / Completeness Contract" ("if an applicable call
//     exceeds that mandatory bound, reject before any alias-bearing argument reaches
//     the client");
//   - "Error Handling" ("Malformed reserved alias on a selected model path: fail closed
//     for that tool call"; "Stale/different workspace tag or incompatible alias
//     flavor: fail closed with workspace_mismatch"; "Mandatory assembly overflow: fail
//     closed for that tool call");
//   - "Existing Architecture and Placement" steps 11/12 (the fail-closed decision is
//     made at finalization, so it happens BEFORE any policy, reactor, or client event);
//   - "Testing Strategy / Runtime-integration" ("Stale/unresolved alias and mandatory
//     overflow never reach client events").
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS ALONGSIDE THE COMPOSITION FILE
//
// The composition guard next door proves the happy path: expansion happens and the
// real path reaches policy, reactor, and client. Requirements.md 4.4, 4.5, and 8.3
// are about the OTHER answers, and their whole point is that a call which CANNOT be
// expanded unambiguously is not released at all. That claim is only worth something
// if it is asserted over what the CLIENT actually received, not over what a
// finalizer returned, because a refusal can be honored on paper and defeated in the
// stream: the assembler could replay original fragments, an unrelated finalizer's
// fallback could reintroduce them, or a lifecycle event could slip through while the
// arguments are held.
//
// So every case below asserts over the WHOLE emitted client-facing event stream,
// with two independent detectors:
//
//   - a LITERAL byte scan for the frozen reserved namespace marker over every
//     serialized client event, which is the simplest possible leak oracle and does
//     not depend on the same recognizer whose silence it is checking;
//   - the PRODUCTION reserved-alias recognizer applied to every selected path field
//     of every released argument document, so the answer does not depend on how the
//     literal is spelled.
//
// It also counts the tool-lifecycle events that reached the client at all, because a
// fail-closed tool call releases none: not the started event, not the arguments, not
// the finished event. A client that can see a tool call without its arguments is in
// exactly the state this feature must not create.
//
// NON-VACUITY
//
// Each case runs against the identical harness with only the alias (or the size)
// changed, and the resolvable case is asserted in the same test function as a
// positive control that DOES release one expanded tool call. A stream scanner that
// reports nothing is therefore distinguishable from a stream that was never scanned.
//
// CONTENT FREEDOM
//
// No failure message contains a path, an alias, a workspace tag, a tool-call ID, or
// argument bytes. Messages carry requirement numbers, byte counts, occurrence counts,
// bounded reason labels, and typed-error classification results only.
//
// DETERMINISM
//
// One mutex-guarded monotonic counter per run, one pinned project root, one
// content-defined alias derivation, a pinned RNG and clock, and a fixture whose size
// is computed from the declared mandatory bound rather than from a mutable
// production field.
