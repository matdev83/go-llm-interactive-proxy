// Spec: b-leg-path-virtualization Task 8.2, the expansion-before-policy half.
// Requirements 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.8, 4.9, 5.1, and 8.3.
//
// Design sections read for this file:
//
//   - "Existing Architecture and Placement" steps 11 and 12 (response tool-call
//     assembly/finalization, then tool policies/reactors) plus the two
//     model-to-client consequences ("model->client expansion uses completed
//     tool-call finalization, not raw ToolCallArgsDelta mutation"; "expansion
//     completes before existing tool policy/reactors");
//   - "7. Path Expansion Finalizer" steps 10 and 11 ("assembler synthesizes the
//     canonical rewritten lifecycle"; "existing tool policies/reactors receive
//     real paths");
//   - "Error Handling" (stale/different workspace tag and mandatory assembly
//     overflow both fail closed);
//   - "Testing Strategy / Runtime-integration" ("Completed model call expands
//     before tool policy observer"; "PTB/backend ingress receives virtualized
//     eligible tool history").
//
// WHAT THIS FILE IS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A SECOND HARNESS
//
// Task 1.2's permanent guard (tool_call_path_expansion_ordering_test.go)
// deliberately uses a minimal test-local expansion pass so that its claims stay
// about the RUNTIME's ordering and metadata delivery. That is the right shape for
// that claim and the wrong shape for a composition claim: the expansion decision
// requirements.md 4.1/4.4/4.5/8.3 demand is made by the concrete feature, so it
// has to be asserted against the concrete feature.
//
// So this file drives the REAL contributions end to end on one executor:
//
//  1. the REAL shipped outbound attempt transform (Task 5.1) on the candidate
//     attempt plane;
//  2. the REAL shipped outbound request-part hook (Task 5.2) on the request-part
//     bus;
//  3. the REAL assembler the runtime builds from the frozen finalizer plane;
//  4. the REAL shipped path-expansion finalizer (Task 8.1) on that plane, with
//     the REAL shipped conservative built-in selector profile, in rewrite mode;
//  5. the REAL tool policy plane and the REAL tool reactor plane.
//
// The only things this file adds are (a) transparent markers that record a stage
// ordinal for the two outbound passes and for the expansion pass, and (b) two
// observers. Neither changes a decision, an identity, an order, or a refusal
// policy. That is the discipline path_virtualization_request_part_hook_regression_test.go
// and tool_call_repair_expansion_composition_test.go already established: a
// marker promotes the production ID/Order/capability and delegates everything
// else, so the chain that sorts, the declaration the assembler reads, and the
// verdict the client sees are all production values.
//
// WHY THE ALIAS THE BACKEND EMITS IS THE ONE THE PROXY MINTED
//
// The historical tool call on the ingress history carries the REAL project root,
// exactly as a coding-agent client replays it. Both real outbound passes rewrite
// it, so by the time the fixture's backend sees the request the history is already
// virtualized. The backend then emits a NEW tool call whose path-bearing argument
// is that very alias plus a distinct suffix: the model echoing back the namespace
// it was shown. The file asserts the backend really received the alias (and never
// the real root) BEFORE asserting anything about what policy, reactor, or client
// see, so a claim that "expansion ran before policy" can never be satisfied by a
// fixture whose alias was never derived here.
//
// CONTENT FREEDOM
//
// No assertion message in this file contains a path, an alias, a workspace tag, a
// tool-call ID, or argument bytes. Paths and the derived alias are compared, never
// formatted. Messages carry requirement numbers, stage ordinals, byte counts,
// occurrence counts, and closed bounded reason labels only.
//
// DETERMINISM
//
// Every ordinal comes from one mutex-guarded monotonic counter, every scan walks
// slices in order, the alias is derived from a fixed project root by a
// content-defined digest, and the executor RNG and clock are pinned by the shared
// harness. Repeated runs produce identical ordinals and counts.

//
//   - the backend-bound request already carries the derived alias and no real root,
//     so the alias the model emits back is one the real outbound passes minted;
//   - the tool policy plane and the tool reactor plane each observe the FULL real
//     path - the complete expanded document, byte for byte, never the reserved alias
//     and never a truncated prefix;
//   - expansion completed before either of them observed an argument value;
//   - the client-facing release is that same expanded complete document, with the
//     non-path sibling preserved and the payload-concept sibling's own bytes intact
//     even though they spell the reserved namespace;
//   - the shipped pass reported a bounded, content-free reason for what it did.
//
// The control run is the fault-injection oracle: the identical fixture with the
// expansion finalizer absent reaches the policy plane, the reactor plane, and the
// client carrying the reserved alias, which is precisely what a missing, inert, or
// misordered expansion pass reproduces.
