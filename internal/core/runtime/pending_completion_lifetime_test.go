// Publication-lifetime regressions for the pending completion-result publication

// Evidence and Pending Result / Concurrency and Lifecycle; requirements 6.3-6.7,
// 11.3, 11.5, 12.5).
//
// Every case here pins one seam of the publication's whole lifetime: reservation,
// staging, activation, physical delivery, and withdrawal. The private value is
// owned for that entire window, so a candidate, its frozen origin, and its usage
// cursor must survive each transition and must disappear at exactly one of them.
//
// The seam-level cases drive the real private drain entry and the real staging
// callback with real channel barriers. Nothing sleeps to coordinate a race, and no
// case installs a fake closed state: the fences under test are the live caller,
// the shared A-leg, the frozen origin, and the publication window.
