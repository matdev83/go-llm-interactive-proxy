// Private, attempt-local control-call interception for
// agent-loop-explicit-completion-protocol (spec:
// .kiro/specs/agent-loop-explicit-completion-protocol, design Response
// Interception / Placement, Handler Semantics, and Concurrency and Lifecycle;
// requirements 3.5, 4.7, 5.1-5.7, 8.2-8.7, 10.3, 11.1-11.3, 12.3-12.5).
//
// This file owns the interception seam only. It runs on the backend-event
// boundary after BTP and provider usage observation and before the ordinary
// tool-call assembler, so a proxy-owned control call never reaches ordinary
// tool-call finalizers, tool policy, tool reactors, response hooks, the client
// recorder, or client release, while operator BTP capture and provider
// accounting keep seeing the legitimate upstream control traffic. Ordinary events
// are returned unchanged, undelayed, and unbuffered.
//
// Ownership comes exclusively from the trusted activation the request path
// already froze. Nothing here re-reads a runtime snapshot, a provider ID() or
// Spec(), capability eligibility, request Extensions, or a mutable context value
// to decide response ownership.
//
// The capture and its normalized outcome are attempt-local mutable state, owned
// by the attempt session under one short-held control lock (attemptSession.controlMu,
// documented at its declaration). The single backend Recv loop observes and hands
// off; attempt lifecycle cleanup — cancellation, Close, attempt loss, and
// replacement — disposes that same state from whichever goroutine owns the
// transition. The lock therefore covers capture observation, handoff bookkeeping,
// outcome storage, and disposal, and nothing else: no Provider.Handle call, no
// backend Recv/Cancel/Close, and no terminal effect ever runs while it is held, so
// cleanup can never wait on an in-flight handler.
//
// Disposal is one-way. A released attempt keeps its immutable activation and a
// visibly released capture, so a late event fails closed instead of reopening the
// capture or falling through to ordinary client tool execution. This file adds no
// timer, no goroutine, no global map, and no public extension metadata.
