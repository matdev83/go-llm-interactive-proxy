package runtime_test

// Spec: b-leg-path-virtualization Task 10.3, the disabled / fail-open / fail-closed
// REGRESSION MATRIX.
// Requirements 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, and 8.5.
//
// Design sections read for this file:
//
//   - "Error Handling" (unsupported/malformed project root: skip mapping, no outbound
//     mutation; unexpected outbound transformation error before alias exposure: fail open
//     to the real path with bounded diagnostics; malformed reserved alias on a selected
//     model path: fail closed for that tool call; stale/different workspace tag:
//     fail closed with workspace_mismatch; mandatory assembly overflow: fail closed);
//   - "Configuration and Composition" ("A disabled resolution returns an EMPTY recorder
//     and the empty bundle", and "Add a new generic plane only if the mandatory
//     buffering contract demonstrably requires it" - which is why the disabled leg is
//     measured through the real composition seam rather than through a stub);
//   - "Observability" (mode, direction, outcome, and a closed reason vocabulary, plus
//     the counters requirements.md 7.6 asks for);
//   - "Testing Strategy / Runtime-integration" ("PTB/backend ingress receives virtualized
//     eligible tool history"; "Stale/unresolved alias and mandatory overflow never reach
//     client events").
//
// WHAT THIS FILE IS
//
// requirements.md 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3 are the feature's FAILURE POLICY, and every other
// file in this package proves one branch of it on one surface. That is the right way to
// prove a branch and the wrong way to read a policy: a reader who wants to know "what
// happens when this feature cannot do its job?" currently has to know that there are six
// files and reconstruct the answer from all of them.
//
// So this file is ONE table. Every row names the direction the failure takes, the bounded
// reason that direction must record, and whether a reserved namespace may reach the
// client, and every row is DRIVEN - not described - so a row that stops holding fails
// where a reader will look for it.
//
// WHY THE TABLE IS THE SPECIFICATION AND NOT A SUMMARY
//
// Two directions exist and they are opposites, which is exactly why they are easy to
// confuse:
//
//   - the OUTBOUND direction fails OPEN. An alias is a token-cost optimization on the
//     way to the BACKEND. Nothing about it is client-visible yet, so when the pass cannot
//     finish, the real path is a perfectly valid request and losing it helps nobody
//     (requirements.md 8.2). Fail-closed here would turn an internal error in an
//     optional optimization into a failed client request;
//   - the INBOUND direction fails CLOSED. Once an alias is model-visible in the current
//     logical trajectory, the only safe answers for a call that cannot be mapped back
//     unambiguously are "release nothing" and "fail" (requirements.md 8.3). An
//     unresolved alias that reaches the client IS a filesystem target the client will
//     act on.
//
// The table's `aliasMayReachClient` column is what makes the difference legible: it is
// false on every row the proxy owns, and true on exactly one - the disabled row, where a
// reserved-namespace byte the MODEL emitted passes through precisely because the feature
// is not there to interpret it, which is what "unchanged" means for that configuration.
//
// WHY TWO ROWS ARE DRIVEN IN THE FEATURE PACKAGE INSTEAD OF HERE
//
// Two outbound conditions cannot be staged through the runtime at all, and saying so
// rather than pretending otherwise is the point:
//
//   - an absent workspace projection (outbound.OutcomeWorkspaceUnresolved). The runtime
//     ALWAYS projects a view on the ordinary path and deliberately projects an EMPTY one
//     on the detached auxiliary path, so no turn exists in which the late pass finds no
//     authority. Driving it means handing the shipped pass a context that never went
//     through that projection;
//   - an unexpected transformation error (outbound.OutcomeTransformationFailed). The
//     shared rewriter's error path is documented as unreachable from untrusted input, and
//     the pass reaches it only through its declared rewriter port, which is package
//     private.
//
// Both are therefore driven in outbound's own internal test file, and both rows below
// name the test that owns them. The bounded reason on those two rows is read from the
// same production enum the feature package asserts against, so the two cannot drift, and
// the driver fails the run if a row names a harness that does not exist.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE
//
// No new end-to-end harness. Every turn-level row runs through the ONE executor harness
// in this package (expRun, and expRunRefusal for the refused rows), extended - never
// duplicated - with the three composition shapes this task needs: the harness's own real
// contributions, the shipped composition seam decoding an operator subtree, and no
// contribution at all. The disabled leg is what those shapes exist for.
//
// CONTENT FREEDOM
//
// No failure message in this file contains a path, an alias, a workspace tag, a
// tool-call ID, a tool name, or an argument byte. Paths and derived aliases are compared
// byte for byte and never formatted. Byte comparisons report event ordinals, event
// KINDS (a closed enum), byte offsets, and byte totals only.
//
// DETERMINISM
//
// Every run pins the executor RNG and clock through the shared harness, the project root
// is a fixed fixture value, the workspace tag is a content-defined digest, every scan
// walks slices in order, and the byte comparison renders with HTML escaping disabled so
// the encoder cannot rewrite the byte it is being asked about. Repeated runs produce
// identical ordinals, counters, and byte streams.
