// Mandatory completeness requirements at the tool-call assembly chokepoint.
//
// A finalizer may publish the optional [toolcall.BufferingRequirement]
// capability to declare that it must receive the complete assembled tool-call
// arguments before the call may be released. The shared assembly limit cannot
// express that on its own: past the shared limit the assembler historically
// gave up, replayed the original stream fragments, and never ran any finalizer,
// which silently bypassed a completeness requirement.
//
// This file holds the assembler-side projection of that capability. It is
// feature-neutral: it names argument size and overflow behavior only, never a
// concrete feature, payload domain, or target namespace.
//
// WHAT IS PROJECTED WHERE, AND WHY
//
// A declaration says two things that are independent of each other: WHICH CALLS
// it governs, and WHAT ITS OWN LIMIT IS for the calls it does govern. Folding
// both into one assembler-wide bound plus one boolean at composition time
// cannot represent either, and every defect this file exists to prevent follows
// from that compression:
//
//   - one BOOLEAN cannot express which calls are in scope, so a call a selective
//     declarer would never inspect inherited its bound AND its refusal policy
//     (requirements 4.6 and 4.7);
//   - one MAXIMUM cannot enforce each declarer's own limit, because the largest
//     bound silently absorbs every smaller one (requirement 4.5);
//   - one BOOLEAN cannot express how many requirements a call carries, so the
//     first declarer to run satisfied all of them (requirement 4.6).
//
// So the projection here is a TABLE, resolved once from the already sorted
// finalizer list: one entry per declarer, each keeping its own validated spec,
// its own identity, and its own applicability capability. Applicability and
// requirement state are then derived PER TOOL CALL, in
// [toolCallAssembler.deriveCallRequirements], from the tool name, the tool
// definition, and the catalog - the only three inputs a consumer may use, so no
// declarer can be forced to expose payload or request state to be enforced.

// Bounded classification codes for a completed tool call the assembler refuses
// closed because a declared mandatory completeness requirement could not be
// honored. They are the whole classification payload of the typed error: no
// path, alias, workspace tag, argument content, tool-call ID, or leg identity
// ever appears in it.
