// Cost and isolation guards for the per-tool-call applicability derivation.
//
// [toolCallAssembler.deriveCallRequirements] runs on the attempt's receive loop
// once per EventToolCallStarted, so its cost is latency on the streaming hot
// path rather than setup cost. It asks every DECLARER whether its declared
// completeness requirement governs the call, and each answer runs on its own
// DETACHED copy of the tool catalog.
//
// WHY THE COPY IS PER DECLARER, which is the load-bearing decision here and the
// thing a cost-only reading of this code gets wrong. The copy exists to keep
// extension code away from state whose integrity the ASSEMBLER depends on, and
// that state is not only the assembler's own catalog: it is every OTHER
// declarer's view of the catalog inside the same derivation. One copy shared
// across declarers would let a declarer that scribbles in place rename or
// rewrite the entries its SIBLING is about to resolve against, so the sibling's
// applicability answer would be computed from forged input. For a sibling that
// declared a mandatory bound that is not a slowdown, it is a silent bypass of
// that sibling's requirement, reached from a sibling that is itself extension
// code: no error, no refusal, and a call released past a bound nobody enforced.
// So each declarer gets an independent copy, and the isolation is per declarer
// rather than merely per derivation.
//
// The consequence for cost is accepted deliberately: an O(catalog) copy per
// declarer, on a chain whose declarer count is bounded by the plugins a host
// composes. What MUST hold is that the growth stays LINEAR in the declarer
// count. A shared copy would be cheaper by a constant factor and is still wrong,
// so the guard below pins LINEARITY, which is the property separating the
// accepted cost from a super-linear regression, and the isolation tests pin the
// reason that constant factor is not available to spend.
//
// The guard is expressed in ALLOCATIONS rather than wall-clock time for the
// reason the sibling scaling guards in this feature use: an allocation count is
// a deterministic function of the code and its input, so it is identical on every
// host, while a timing threshold is not.
//
// The cost test is deliberately SERIAL. testing.AllocsPerRun reads process-wide
// allocation state, so a concurrent parallel sibling would be counted as this
// file's own.
