// Spec: b-leg-path-virtualization Task 10.1. Requirements 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5,
// and 6.6.
//
// Design sections read for this file:
//
//   - "Continuity and State" (no persistent data model; the primary mapping is
//     reconstructed on every request/attempt from the authoritative project root and
//     the fixed V1 algorithm; therefore same root/flavor produces the same workspace
//     tag and alias after restart/reload; provider-side continuation for an unchanged
//     root continues to use the same alias; a changed root derives a different tag, so
//     a provider-retained old alias fails closed rather than rebinding; NO prior-root
//     dictionary is needed because the stale tag is carried in the alias itself);
//   - "2. Workspace-Bound Alias Identity" (exact tag algorithm, exact V1 virtual-root
//     forms, and the "Reserved-alias recognition and stale-root rule" steps 1-6);
//   - "Configuration and Composition" (the three components are built from one
//     compiled resolution, and standard registration follows existing conventions);
//   - "Error Handling" ("Stale/different workspace tag or incompatible alias flavor:
//     fail closed with workspace_mismatch").
//
// WHAT THIS FILE IS
//
// Task 8.2 characterized ONE turn. This file characterizes ACROSS turns and across
// component lifetimes, which is the half of the feature requirements.md 6 exists for
// and the half no earlier test could reach: every test shipped so far builds ONE
// feature object, pins ONE root, and drives ONE turn. A prior-root dictionary, a cached
// mapping, a tag derived from anything but the pinned root, a continuation path that
// re-derives differently from a full-history path, or a Windows/UNC root change are all
// invisible to those tests and all fail here.
//
// WHAT IT REUSES
//
// The real runtime harness from Task 8.2 - expRun/expScenario, the real shipped
// outbound attempt transform, the real shipped request-part hook, the real shipped
// expansion finalizer, the real assembler, the real backend boundary, the real tool
// policy and reactor planes, and the real client-event stream. Task 10.1 adds NO
// second end-to-end harness and NO stand-in component. The only additions to the
// shared harness are additive scenario fields (an ingress override and a pinned root
// override), a remeasurement helper that hands back the exact selected path value
// rather than only counting it, and flavor-correct document escaping, because
// requirements.md 6.5 enumerates Windows and UNC root changes and a POSIX-only harness
// could not reach them.
//
// The composition itself is reused too: the reload and continuation observations build
// a generation through the shipped bundle.FeatureBundle seam and drive the three
// components it published, rather than re-constructing them by hand.
//
// HOW RECREATION AND RESTART ARE PERFORMED
//
// Four independent observations of the same identity:
//
//  1. COMPONENT RECREATION. contPublishedComponents decodes the operator subtree and
//     builds the bundle afresh, and the previous generation's components are released
//     before the next one exists. The component IDENTITIES are compared, so "rebuilt"
//     is a checked fact rather than a claim.
//  2. GENERATION RELOAD. A generation compiled with a DIFFERENT declared completeness
//     bound sits between two observations of the plain subtree, so the two are not two
//     references to one compiled resolution and a workspace identity that secretly
//     depended on generation-scoped configuration would move.
//  3. PROCESS RESTART. The identity is re-derived in a genuinely separate OS process
//     started from this test binary, which shares no address space, no heap, and no
//     package-level variable with the test.
//  4. FULL RUNTIME TURNS. expRun constructs every runtime component from scratch on
//     every invocation, so two turns share no executor, no finalizer, and no resolver.
//
// CONTENT FREEDOM
//
// No assertion message in this file contains a path, an alias, a workspace tag, or a
// tool-call ID. Roots, aliases, and tags are compared, never formatted. Messages carry
// requirement numbers, occurrence counts, byte totals, bounded reason labels, tag
// LENGTHS, and stage ordinals only. The places that must reason about a root's bytes
// report the root's LENGTH and whether two values are equal, which is enough to
// distinguish the cases without printing one.
//
// DETERMINISM
//
// Every run pins its root as a literal, derives the alias by the frozen content-
// defined digest, walks slices in order, uses the shared seeded RNG and pinned clock,
// and orders every scan by sorted key rather than map iteration. The one child process
// the restart test starts reads nothing from the parent and is bounded by a generous
// deadline. Repeated runs produce identical aliases, tags, counts, and ordinals, so
// -count=5 is a real repeat rather than a re-shuffle.

// contContinuationCall is the CANONICAL provider-side continuation shape this

//
// The chain, read from the repository:
//
//  1. lipapi.Call.PreviousResponseID (pkg/lipapi/call.go:72-75) documents the field
//     as "a proxy-owned continuation parent" which "allows an item-authoritative
//     continuation request to carry an intentionally empty input item slice; the
//     continuation resolver supplies the materialized items", and Call.Validate
//     enforces exactly that pairing (call.go:107): an item-authoritative call with no
//     items is legal ONLY when a previous-response id is set.
//  2. The OpenResponses decoder produces that shape.
//     internal/plugins/protocols/openresponses/decode_request.go:155-163 keeps a
//     NON-NIL EMPTY canonicalItems slice "so the canonical call remains
//     item-authoritative" precisely because previous_response_id is set, and sets
//     PreviousResponseID at decode_request.go:235. With `input` present the slice
//     instead holds the new input items - still item-authoritative, still with the
//     continuation parent.
//  3. The frontend resolves the parent BEFORE the runtime sees the call:
//     internal/plugins/frontends/openresponses/handler_pipe.go:402 calls the resolver,
//     and pkg/lipsdk/continuation/materialize.go:56-63 rebuilds the call as
//     CloneCall(baseCall) with Items replaced by the materialized trajectory and
//     Messages/Instructions cleared. CloneCall copies the struct by value, so the
//     continuation parent SURVIVES materialization.
//
// So the shape the runtime actually receives on a provider-retained continuation is:
// item authority, a continuation parent, and an item trajectory carrying the retained
// model-visible history plus the new input. That is what this fixture builds. The
// retained tool call below is the path-bearing surface the model saw in the prior
// turn - which is exactly the surface requirements.md 6.4 says the continued turn
// must keep addressing with the SAME alias.
// contContinuationCall builds the continued turn for one continuation parent.
//

// provider-side continuation is unbounded in number, and every one of them must

// design.md "Continuity and State"'s closing sentence: "no prior-root dictionary is
// needed to identify a stale alias because the stale tag is carried in the alias
// itself."
//
// THREE independent oracles, because the property is an absence and an absence proved
// one way is weak:
//
//  1. BEHAVIORAL, ORDER INDEPENDENT. Deriving root A, then root B, then root A again,
//     yields the identical tag each time. A store that remembered the FIRST mapping
//     would return it for the third call.
//
//  2. BEHAVIORAL, THE MAPPING VALUE CARRIES NO STORE. pathvirtualization.Mapping is
//     reflected over field by field: exactly the four declared scalar/identifier
//     fields, no map, slice, pointer, channel, or function. A mapping that carried a
//     dictionary would have to hold one of those.
//
//  3. STRUCTURAL, OVER THE WHOLE FEATURE TREE. Every PRODUCTION source is parsed and
//     scanned for a package-level map or sync.Map, because package scope is the only
//     place in Go where state can outlive a single call without the caller holding it.
//
// The structural guard is NON-VACUOUS four times over, and all four run the SAME
// detector this oracle uses:
//
//   - it FATALS when its file set is empty, and again when the file set is smaller than
//     a floor, so a tree walk that silently stopped covering the feature cannot pass;
//   - it must FIRE on exactly the two shapes it forbids - a package-level map and a
//     package-level sync.Map - so a detector that matched nothing is caught;
//   - it must NOT fire on a function-local map, so it cannot degrade into "no maps
//     anywhere", which would be unmaintainable and would hide the property;
//   - it must skip an allowlisted declaration WITHOUT skipping its file, so the
//     allowlist cannot become a per-file loophole.
//
// And the one audited exception is property-checked rather than trusted: it must stay a
// string-keyed set, be declared exactly once in the named file, and never be assigned
// anywhere in the tree.
