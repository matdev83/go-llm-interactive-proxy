// Spec: b-leg-path-virtualization post-certification review, defect 1 (P1) —
// the post-declaration replay residual, proved over the REAL composition.
// Requirements 4.1, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 8.3.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS ALONGSIDE THE ASSEMBLER-LEVEL REGRESSION
//
// tool_call_post_declaration_preserve_test.go drives the chokepoint directly with
// a stand-in declaring pass. This file drives the REAL shipped expansion
// finalizer, the REAL outbound passes, and the REAL tool policy and tool reactor
// planes, over a model-emitted document whose selected path member carries the
// frozen reserved namespace.
//
// That distinction is the whole point of the defect. The residual was never
// reachable through a finalizer sorting BELOW the declaring pass - that direction
// is the assembler-level chokepoint, already proven. It was reachable through a
// finalizer sorting ABOVE it, and the only way to observe that at production
// fidelity is a run whose declaring participant is the shipped one and whose later
// participant is an ordinary finalizer an operator could genuinely register.
//
// WHAT IT ASSERTS
//
//   - selected paths contain no unresolved alias; unselected fields remain intact;
//   - the preserved call reaches tool policies, reactors and the client before
//     the later error, rather than being discarded by terminal cleanup;
//   - the declaring pass really ran and really published the expansion, so there
//     was a mandatory-safe result to preserve and the case is not vacuous;
//   - the turn still fails, and with the LATER finalizer's own error rather than
//     with the assembler's own typed refusal.
//
// A POSITIVE CONTROL runs the identical fixture with no later failing finalizer and
// requires one clean expanded tool call, so preservation is distinguishable
// from a stream that was never scanned. A PRE-DECLARATION CONTROL runs the same
// failing finalizer BELOW the shipped order and requires the assembler's own
// bounded incomplete-requirement refusal, so the two halves of the decision cannot
// be confused with one another.
//
// IT IS NOT AN ORDERING RULE. Nothing here changes a finalizer's declared order or
// the assembler's iteration; the later participant is placed above the declaring one
// only so the residual's precondition holds. A core ordering rule remains rejected.
//
// CONTENT FREEDOM: no failure message in this file contains a path, an alias, a
// workspace tag, an argument byte, or a tool-call identifier. Messages carry
// requirement numbers, byte counts, occurrence counts, bounded reason labels, and
// typed-error classification results only.
