// IN-FLIGHT half of the generation pin for the private control-tool contract
// (spec: .kiro/specs/agent-loop-explicit-completion-protocol, design Concurrency
// and Lifecycle "Reload can switch strategies for new requests without changing
// in-flight strategy" and "Withdrawal leaves no durable protocol row or stale
// overlay to clean"; requirements 10.3 and 10.6).
//
// Why this cell sits next to
// TestControlToolProjection_reloadPinsActivationToItsOwnGeneration: that cell is
// purely sequential (request 1 finishes, then the snapshot is replaced, then
// request 2 is admitted), so it certifies only the newly-admitted half of
// requirement 10.3. This cell certifies the half that the conformance cell
// TestPreferredProtocolTransportE2E_reloadSwitchesStrategyForNewlyAdmittedTurns
// explicitly declines to assert: a request that is ALREADY admitted when a newer
// generation is published keeps the strategy and control-tool provenance of its
// original generation for every later stage of its own lifetime.
//
// The reload seam here is the PRODUCTION one, not a harness field write.
// Executor.RuntimeSnapshot is a plain field production never mutates after
// composition: a reload publishes a NEW immutable generation object carrying its
// own executor through runtimehost.Manager.Publish (an atomic pointer swap) and
// retires the previous generation without touching it. That is the only shape in
// which "a newer generation was published while this request is in flight" is
// expressible at all, and it is why this cell never swaps RuntimeSnapshot under
// a live request — that is a harness-side data race, not a production reload.
// The publication below happens on the in-flight request's own goroutine, so the
// cell is race free by construction rather than by timing.
//
// Generic runtime only. Generation 1 contributes the same anonymous
// `proxy_control` model control tool any feature generation would contribute
// through feature.PlaneControlToolProvider and generation 2 withdraws it, which
// is exactly the shape of a real Agent Loop Guard strategy reload from the
// preferred attempt_completion protocol to the legacy semantic-verifier
// strategy: same request, same wire, same projection stage, different strategy.
