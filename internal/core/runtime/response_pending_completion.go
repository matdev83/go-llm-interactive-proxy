//
// This file owns one private, bounded terminal-publication value for a valid
// proxy-owned completion. It is not a gate engine, a terminal owner, a registry,
// or a side channel to a frontend: the accepted request-terminal owner calls it
// from inside the winning request effects, and every effect it performs runs
// through the existing response observation seam.
//
// Ownership of each fact:
//
//   - The bounded lexical result is a copy taken from the winning attempt's
//     private control state under that attempt's control lock, before attempt
//     cleanup disposes it. It is dropped by every losing, errored, continued,
//     cancelled, or closed path.
//   - The canonical events are ordinary legal response/message/text events. They
//     run the existing response-part hooks exactly once each and participate in
//     the existing completion-gate chain exactly once. No synthetic client tool
//     call, tool result, or item is ever produced.
//   - Eligibility uses trimmed released assistant text plus post-hook assistant
//     text already inside the gate buffer. The general output-committed bit is
//     deliberately not used, because reasoning, tool, and media output also commit
//     while proving nothing about an assistant answer existing.
//   - An unresolved, incomplete, ambiguous, or over-capacity ordinary tool
//     boundary in the held candidate suppresses the automatic result even when
//     the terminal provider allowed the stop. Ordinary canonical output is never
//     suppressed with it.
//
// The prepared value is not released while it is prepared. Every effect it needs
// runs exactly once at the accepted publication boundary, and the private release
// drain below exists only to deliver already-observed events to the client in
// canonical order.
