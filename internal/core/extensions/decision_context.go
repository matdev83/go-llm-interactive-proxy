// DecisionContextOptions carries the non-view inputs needed to assemble a

// target stage/provider (requirements 2.1, 6.3). All fields are optional; zero values
// preserve legacy/local-anonymous semantics.
type DecisionContextOptions struct {
	// OutputCommitted records whether client-visible output has already been committed for
	// this request (completion/stream-stage decisions). False for pre-backend stages.
	OutputCommitted bool
	// EvaluationTimeout is the configured decision-provider evaluation budget for the
	// target stage/provider. Zero means no new timeout is applied (legacy behavior).

// BuildDecisionContext assembles a safe, request-scoped policydecision.Context from the
// trusted execution views attached to an accepted request, plus stage/provider metadata,
// output-committed state, and the evaluation timeout budget (requirements 2.1-2.6, 7.5).
//
// Safety properties:
//   - Authoritative scope comes from views.Scope (safe-by-construction: no raw credentials,
//     headers, resume tokens, or unvetted claims). It is carried separately from the legacy
//     views.Principal projection (requirement 2.6).
//   - Internal/auxiliary origin and parent trace attribution are preserved through
//     views.Scope.Origin and views.Scope.ParentTraceID (requirement 2.4).
//   - Unknown optional scope fields are preserved as unknown rather than inferred from
//     client payloads (requirement 2.2).
//   - The returned context is defensively cloned: mutating its maps, slices, or embedded
//     scope cannot affect the caller's views (requirement 7.7).
//
// The builder does not synthesize unsafe annotation entries or pull in raw request payloads;
// only the views' existing annotations are carried through.
