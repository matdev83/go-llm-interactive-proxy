// unknownSelfDefenseReason is the single finite bucket every reason outside the
// closed vocabulary collapses into. It is a constant: an unrecognized or
// attacker-influenced reason can never widen the label set.
const unknownSelfDefenseReason = "unknown"

// SelfDefenseProm exposes the three bounded ingress self-defense process
// metrics: denial count by finite reason, quarantine-transition count by finite
// reason, and the current adaptive-state entry count.
//
// Label safety is structural, not conventional, and it covers the label VALUE as
// well as the label NAME. Both counters declare exactly one variable label,
// "reason", and the entry gauge declares none; the value of that label is a switch
// over the closed [ingressdefense.AllReasons] vocabulary whose only other outcome
// is the constant "unknown" bucket, so a source address, CIDR text, request path,
// query, header, User-Agent, credential, principal, country, or any other
// attacker-controlled string cannot become a series dimension on any code path
// (requirement 9.4). The invariant is enforced on the REAL process bundle
// registry, not only through this file: selfDefenseBundleLabelFindings reads every
// family published under the lip_self_defense_ prefix through registry.Gather and
// rejects both a label name outside {"reason"} and a "reason" value outside the
// closed vocabulary, so a sibling file that bypasses selfDefenseReasonLabel cannot
// smuggle a value through. The known boundary of that guard is its name prefix: a
// self-defense series renamed out of lip_self_defense_ is outside its scope.
//
// Every method is total: a nil collector, an unbound entry-count source, and any
// reason string are no-ops that cannot panic and cannot return an error. Metrics
// are therefore non-authoritative — an observability absence can never change a
// security decision or a state mutation (design "Error Handling").
//
// The entry-count gauge is scrape-driven, exactly like the process-owned
// PostgreSQL pool collector: it reads the adaptive state live on every scrape, so
// it reports the current entry count including successful-auth clears, bounded
// eviction and lazy hostile-inactivity expiry, and it adds no work to the request
// path. The transition-time entry count is therefore intentionally not stored.

// middleware.go:101, :112 and :125 each precede forbidden/notFound/tooManyRequests
// — and the 403 resolution-failure path at middleware.go:101 mutates no adaptive
// state at all, so a panicking label lookup (a prometheus client panics when a
// vec's declared label arity does not match the supplied values) may cost only
