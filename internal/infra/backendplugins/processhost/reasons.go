// Reason is a bounded stable process-host outcome code (no paths/secrets).
//
// These constants are outcome codes, not sentinel errors: ReasonOK is a success
// code, so the Err prefix convention for error sentinels does not apply. The
// names follow the enum convention (type name prefix + value). Error() is
// implemented so reasons can be wrapped and matched with errors.Is.
//
//nolint:errname // outcome codes (incl. success), not error sentinels
