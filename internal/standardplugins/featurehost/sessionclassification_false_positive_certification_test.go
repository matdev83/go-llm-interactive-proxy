// Task 10.2 false-positive certification.
//
// A false-positive suite is only worth its ability to fail, so this file is built
// around three instruments that make a vacuous PASS impossible:
//
//  1. Every fixture's evidence is observed FROM THE RUNTIME, not from the test's
//     own declaration. The submit hook receives the same working call the
//     classification stage read, so the recorded client User-Agent, tool names
//     and delivered user text are exactly what the production heuristic saw. The
//     completeness census then REJECTS a run in which two fixtures the suite
//     distinguishes were delivered the same evidence, and REJECTS a fixture
//     whose declared weak signal never reached the turn. Task 10.1 was rejected
//     for exactly that gap: six rows carried byte-identical generic filler while
//     logging PASS.
//
//  2. Every negative's reason for staying unknown is MEASURED, not inferred. The
//     production decision function is evaluated on the delivered evidence and
//     must report no promotion at all, and the same authoritative session is then
//     re-served with ONE independent decisive rule added to the very same turn
//     evidence. A negative that stayed unknown because nothing could ever promote
//     it would fail the pairing; a negative that stayed unknown for a wrong reason
//     fails the no-decisive-rule measurement.
//
//  3. "No durable negative classification" is proven at the TABLE, by raw SQL
//     over every row the feature wrote, and per session through an independent
//     store instance. A row with an empty or otherwise non-positive kind is
//     reported as a row that must not exist.
//
// Nothing here re-implements a classification rule, a tool category, a store, or
// a wire profile. Requirements 1.2, 3.2, 3.4-3.8, 12.2 and 12.3 are certified
// against the real composed surfaces: a real featurehost process, a real compiled
// generation whose classifier is the production one, the real generic-core
// executor on both the canonical and the large-payload wire lane, and the
// production durable SQLite store.
//
// The remote half of requirement 6.8 (a below-threshold or failed remote decision
// must not persist a negative classification) needs a hermetic decider, so it lives
// with the durable store it writes to:
// internal/standardplugins/featurehost/sessionclassification/negative_durable_certification_test.go.
