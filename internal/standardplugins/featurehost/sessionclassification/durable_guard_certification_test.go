// Task 9.2 durable-guard certification.
//
// One guard in BunStore is not reachable through the store API alone, so it needs an
// explicit construction to be pinned at all.
//
// CompleteRemote's positive UPDATE carries `AND kind = ''`. Through the public
// contract that predicate can never be the deciding one:
//
//   - Promote clears remote_lease_id when it installs a positive, so a positive row
//     never holds the lease token a later completion must match.
//   - ClaimRemote refuses any key that already holds a positive.
//   - CompleteRemote clears the lease on every accepted completion.
//
// So the token guard (`AND remote_lease_id = ? AND remote_attempts = ?`) always
// rejects first, and removing `AND kind = ''` changes nothing observable through the
// API. That is precisely why an ordinary test cannot tell whether the guard is
// load-bearing.
//
// The state is nevertheless reachable at the TABLE, which is the shared boundary:
// the table is durable and multi-writer, so a row can carry a positive together with
// a live lease token written by another writer, an older generation, or a manual
// operation. The guard is what keeps the re-source invariant at that boundary. The
// test below constructs exactly that row through raw SQL - the same technique the
// established dbparity contract uses for its control row - so the guard is exercised
// on the deciding predicate instead of being masked by the token guard.

// sessionClassificationRawInsert writes one durable classification row directly,
// bypassing the store API. It is the only way to reach the states the store's own
// monotonicity guards make unreachable through its public contract.
