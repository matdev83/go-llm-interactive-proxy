// Task 10.2 remote negative certification for requirements 1.5, 6.8 and 6.9.
//
// The composed false-positive suite in
// internal/standardplugins/featurehost covers the LOCAL negatives through the real
// canonical and wire lanes. The remote negatives cannot be certified there: the
// standard featurehost wires its decider by dependency injection from the vendor
// adapter, and a hermetic run has to supply the decider itself. So the durable
// half is certified here, against the production SQLite-backed store, the
// production coordinator and lease, and the production classifier's remote phase,
// with only the vendor transport replaced by a scripted bounded answer.
//
// What is proven, per outcome:
//
//   - a valid remote result BELOW the configured threshold leaves the session
//     unknown, spends a bounded attempt, and persists NO negative classification;
//   - a remote timeout, rate limit, server failure, transport failure and
//     malformed/unmappable answer each preserve the user request, leave the
//     session unknown, and persist NO negative classification;
//   - the same negative turns never rewrite an established positive; and
//   - an ABOVE-threshold result in the very same harness does persist a positive,
//     which is what makes every negative above load-bearing instead of vacuous.
//
// The durable claim is checked twice, because the store's own Load path validates a
// row and would report a persisted negative as an error rather than as a value:
//
//   - through an INDEPENDENT store instance over the same database, and
//   - through a RAW census of the classification table, so a row carrying any kind
//     outside the V1 vocabulary is visible as a fact rather than hidden behind a
//     validation refusal.
