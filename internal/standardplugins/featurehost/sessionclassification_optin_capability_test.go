// Task 10.3 consumer capability and neutrality certification.
//
// This file proves the two halves of "the feature is usable, and nothing else
// changed because of it":
//
//   - requirements 1.6 and 4.2: a downstream consumer that opts into
//     classification can gate on the VERY FIRST eligible turn, deciding from the
//     immutable snapshot alone - no User-Agent, no prompt or transcript, no
//     classifier re-run, no vendor result.
//
//   - requirements 1.8 and 11.7: that capability is not exercised by anything
//     that ships. With the plane absent the consumer stays inert, the turn still
//     routes and streams, and the feature emits no observation of any kind.
//
// Everything runs through the real composed surfaces: a real featurehost process,
// a real compiled generation carrying the production classifier, a real
// generic-core executor, the production pre-request plane, and the production
// durable SQLite store.
//
// The wire lane is served by the SAME generation but with the UNMODIFIED plane
// set, because PlanePreRequestHandlers is canonical-required and a consumer there
// statically blocks the large-payload lane (task 7.3). The harness serves a wire
// turn, so "the test-only consumer does not take the wire lane down with it" is
// measured rather than asserted in a comment.
