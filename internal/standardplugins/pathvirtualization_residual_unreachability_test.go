// This file owns ONE mechanical property for Task 12.2, and it is the premise the
// accepted post-declaration replay residual rests on.
//
// THE RESIDUAL. internal/core/runtime/tool_call_assembler.go's finalizeCall refuses
// closed on an unusable result while a well-formed mandatory completeness
// requirement is still UNDECIDED (ReasonMandatoryBufferingIncomplete), and clears
// that pending flag as soon as the declaring finalizer is invoked. So once the
// expansion pass at Order 41 has run, an ordinary finalizer sorting ABOVE 41 that
// fails, returns an unknown action, or returns an invalid rewrite envelope falls
// back to the assembler's pre-existing behaviour of replaying buf.originals - and
// those originals still carry the reserved alias, with err == nil.
//
// Task 7.2's review accepted and reserved that residual, and Task 12.2 owns the
// decision. It is characterized, not hidden, by
// internal/core/runtime/tool_call_repair_expansion_composition_test.go's
// `residual_after_the_declaring_finalizer_ran_the_replay_fallback_still_applies`.
//
// WHY IT IS UNREACHABLE IN THE SHIPPED COMPOSITION, AND WHY THAT MUST BE PROVEN
// RATHER THAN ASSUMED. The residual needs a finalizer that sorts at or above the
// declaring expansion pass. Two mechanisms already refuse that generation, and
// neither is a reordering rule:
//
//   - pathvirtualizationconfig.ValidateGenerationComposition (called from
//     featurehost.CompileGeneration, internal/standardplugins/featurehost/generation.go:57)
//     REFUSES PUBLICATION when this feature is enabled, tool-call repair is enabled,
//     and repair's EFFECTIVE finalizer order is >= expansion.FinalizerOrder. That is
//     the only other tool-call finalizer in the shipped distribution, and its `order`
//     is otherwise unbounded above - so the guard, not the number, is what keeps it
//     strictly below 41.
//   - the two shipped orders are 40 (toolcallrepair.DefaultFinalizerOrder) and 41
//     (expansion.FinalizerOrder), so the stock pairing already composes.
//
// Neither mechanism is visible from inside the two feature packages: they are two
// different packages, and the property spans both. So the property is asserted HERE,
// at the composition root that actually owns the finalizer plane, by driving the
// REAL `MergeFeatureSurfacesWithHost` over the REAL standard registry and reading
// the FINALIZED chain the runtime would iterate.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT DO. It does not reorder finalizers, and it does not add a
// core rule. It states a fact about the composition this distribution publishes, so
// a future third finalizer sorting above 41 fails here - at the composition root,
// where the decision belongs - rather than silently reopening a security-relevant
// leak that three separate chokepoints were built to close.
