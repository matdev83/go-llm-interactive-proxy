// Observer receives bounded self-defense observations. Every reason is a member
// of the closed [ingressdefense.AllReasons] vocabulary; no request path, source
// address, prefix text, query, header, User-Agent, credential or principal ever
// reaches it, so it can only ever produce finite metric labels. Observer absence
// or failure is not authoritative: metrics never decide or change a security
// outcome.

// CredentialProbe is the conservative private credential-presence probe.
//
// It reports whether the active transport-auth provider chain might still

// refuse a quarantined source before authentication: a credential-bearing
// request, a credential-free provider, an unknown/custom provider, or a provider
// without the private capability must all report true, so a legitimate user
// behind shared NAT, VPN or corporate egress is never locked out by another actor
// on the same public address. A nil probe fails open to the normal auth chain.

// Input is the generation-scoped, non-owning self-defense gate projection.

// [ingressdefense.State] capability shared by every generation, and Policy is the
// immutable reloadable policy of this generation.

	// Resolver is the already-compiled GeoIP client-address trust configuration.

	// and no second trust boundary; the same parser bounds and fail-closed

	// matcher; adaptive quarantine behavior is retained.
	ImpossiblePaths bool
	// OwnedRoutes are the data-plane routes the RUNNING ROUTER owns, already
	// resolved with the router's own match semantics: an exact registration owns
	// one method/path pair, a trailing-slash registration owns its subtree, and
	// comparison is case-sensitive exactly as the router's is.
	//
	// A published route is authoritative, so the deterministic matcher never
	// refuses one. The configuration surface for a frontend base path and for a
	// diagnostics, metrics or operator-mount path is any normalized absolute
	// non-root path, which includes paths inside the frozen impossible families, so
	// without this inventory a default-on security layer would make a valid
	// configuration's route unreachable.
	//
	// This is the router's answer, not a path-shaped guess: a configured path whose
	// feature is disabled is not mounted and therefore carves nothing, and an exact
	// registration does not carve its own subtree. An empty or absent inventory
	// keeps the full pre-carve behavior, so a generation that projects no inventory
	// still refuses every frozen family.

//  1. resolve the source address with the existing GeoIP resolver semantics; a
//     resolver failure returns a generic 403 and stops;
//  2. attach the normalized source address to the request context;
//  3. when impossible-path matching is enabled and the path matches and is not a
//     route this generation publishes, record one probe offense for a
//     non-adaptively-exempt source, record finite metrics and return a generic
//     404;
//  4. an adaptively-exempt source delegates immediately, without inspecting
//     adaptive quarantine state;
//  5. a source that is not quarantined delegates;
//  6. a quarantined source is refused with a generic 429 only when the
//     conservative credential probe proves it cannot authenticate as presented,
//     and otherwise reaches the normal transport-auth chain.
//
// Adaptive exemption is applied before both the quarantine lookup and the probe
// offense, and never overrides fixed network policy or the deterministic
// impossible-path refusal.
