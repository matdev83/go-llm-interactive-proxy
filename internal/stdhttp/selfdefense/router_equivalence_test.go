// TestConfiguredPercentEscapesCannotShadowOrCarveAnything is the P1 regression.
//
// http.ServeMux unescapes both the registered pattern and the request path, so a
// pattern written with escapes owns a request whose DECODED path is the unescaped
// form. A configured path that contains a percent escape therefore publishes a route
// whose decoded form is invisible to the carve: the real request has
// r.URL.Path == "/wp-admin/responses", which matches the frozen /wp-admin family and
// would be refused before the frontend.
//
// The fix is to forbid percent escapes in operator-configurable paths, so a
// registered pattern and its decoded request path can never disagree. This test
// pins the resulting invariant: no configured path can produce an escape, so the
// carved surface and the router's own answers always agree.
