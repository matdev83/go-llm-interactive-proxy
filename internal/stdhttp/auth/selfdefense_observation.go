// SelfDefenseHooks is the optional ingress self-defense observation seam the

// nothing, which is the structural disabled posture: [Middleware] is then exactly
// the pre-existing request path. The hooks never decide an authentication
// outcome; the provider chain stays authoritative for status, headers and body,
// and both hooks are no-ops unless the outer gate published a source-address
// snapshot for this request.
