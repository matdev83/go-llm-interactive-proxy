// CredentialDisposition is the closed, conservative answer of the credential
// presence question the ingress self-defense gate asks before it may refuse a
// quarantined source in front of authentication.

// The two members carry no credential material, so the answer can never become a
// credential-validity oracle, and the ordering is normative: MayAuthenticate is
// the zero value, so an unprojected probe, an unknown provider and any future
// member all fail open to the normal transport-auth chain.

// an EXACT registration, which owns one method/path pair, and a SUBTREE

// into a plain string is what previously made the carve a case-insensitive subtree
// and let probes through that the router does not route.

// so self-defense creates no second forwarding parser and no second trust
// boundary, and it needs no GeoIP country database.
