// self-defense route normalizer.
//
// The second half is the property that actually prevents a route from being shadowed.
// If the self-defense normalizer rewrites the registered path in any way -- cutting at
// a decoded "?", collapsing a leading separator run, folding a trailing slash -- then
// the carve is reasoning about a different string than the router registered, which is
// the disagreement that produced every finding in this series.
//
// The fixed point is stated on the REGISTERED path, not on the raw configured value:
// a configured "/admin/" is legitimate because validation normalizes it to "/admin"
// before anything is mounted, so the string the router registered is "/admin". What
// must hold is that the normalizer cannot move it from there.
