// This file owns the integration between one generation's local decision, the
// shared durable lease state, and the remote decider. It retains nothing between
// turns: every remote fact it needs comes from the immutable policy, the
// process-owned store, or the frozen port (requirements 10.3, 10.5, 10.7).
//
// The sequence is fixed, and it is the structural guarantee requirement 10.4
// asks for: claim, release every store lock, network, complete. No store
// transaction, database connection, or coordinator mutex is held while a decider
// runs, so a slow or hung remote service cannot serialize unrelated sessions.

// remoteResult is the bounded projection of one leased remote attempt. It holds
// only the classification snapshot the store accepted, the attempt number the
// store assigned, and the record the store returned, so a caller cannot observe
// the decider, the lease, or any request content through it.

	// accepted reports whether this turn's completion was accepted rather than
	// stale, which is what distinguishes an established positive from one another
	// turn established (requirement 9.1).
	accepted bool
	// promoted reports that this turn's own accepted completion established the
	// positive. It is the first-positive-ownership rule for the remote path.
