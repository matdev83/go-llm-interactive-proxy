// This file reads the conservative subset of a declared JSON Schema that the
// inference step is willing to reason about, and refuses everything else with a
// bounded signal. It is a projection, not a schema implementation: a node records
// only its declared kind, its declared child properties, its declared array item
// schema, and its declared description, plus two failure signals that stop the
// walk (an unreadable structure and a member declared twice).
//
// Reading is deliberately lossy in the safe direction. Keywords the step cannot
// interpret as a single unambiguous shape — every reference, composition,
// conditional, and tuple keyword — mark the node ambiguous instead of being
// skipped, so one unverifiable branch removes that tool from inference rather than
// leaving a partially trusted surface behind. The same applies to arbitrary-key
// channels: `additionalProperties` and `patternProperties` are declared in ways
// this step does not traverse at all, because a member name chosen by an arbitrary
// key or a pattern is not a declared property (design.md 226).
//
// The projection is also a bounded window rather than the whole declaration. The
// walk decides on a declared node only inside that window, so nothing below it is
// read at all; that is what keeps the reader's cost a constant multiple of the
// declared size instead of scaling with nesting depth.

// Structural failures the step can report. They are distinct from a syntax
// failure so a caller can tell "this is not a schema object" from "these bytes are
// not readable", which is the difference between a tool that declares a different
// kind and a tool whose declaration cannot be read at all.

// The window is the walk's own reachable window, read from infer.go's descend:
//   - a node at or below maxSchemaDepth is inspected, so its declared kind,
//     description, properties, item schema, and structural signals are all read;
//   - a node at maxSchemaDepthWindow is the level descend refuses before it
//     inspects anything, having first checked the declared member name against
//     the vocabulary and the payload denylist. Only those two facts are read, and
//     its own children are not;
//   - nothing below that is ever inspected, traversed, or published, so it is not
//     read. Reading it would be work whose result is discarded, and because every
//     level re-scans the bytes below it, doing so would make the read quadratic in
//     declared nesting depth.
//
// Every level the window does admit is read at most once per enclosing node, and
// the subtrees of two nodes at the same level are disjoint, so one read costs at
// most (maxSchemaDepthWindow+1) times the declared size. The declared size is
