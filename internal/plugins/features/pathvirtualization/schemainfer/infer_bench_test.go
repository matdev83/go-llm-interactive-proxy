// Spec: b-leg-path-virtualization Task 11.1, requirements.md 9.2, 9.3, 9.4 and 9.6,
// against design.md "Testing Strategy / Benchmarks" and the "Performance" section's
// "Selector traversal is bounded by config/schema/canonical limits".
//
// This file measures the schema-inference read, because that read is the one place in
// this feature whose cost is a function of ATTACKER- or PROVIDER-SUPPLIED declared
// bytes rather than of the workspace's own paths. An earlier round of this feature
// found a quadratic parse cost here: a 185 KB declared chain spent 14.7 s because
// every level re-entered the decoder on its own full subtree. The reader now reads a
// bounded window of declared levels, so its cost is a constant multiple of the
// DECLARED SIZE rather than of nesting depth.
//
// These two benchmarks are the standing evidence for that fix, and they probe it from
// the two directions that matter:
//
//   - BenchmarkInferArgumentsWideDeclaredSchema grows the declared WIDTH at one level,
//     so a reader that re-scanned per node would show up as a rising per-byte cost;
//   - BenchmarkInferArgumentsDeepDeclaredChain grows the declared DEPTH far past the
//     read window, so a reader that read below the window would show up as a cost that
//     stops tracking the declared size at all.
//
// Neither benchmark asserts on elapsed time. Both report the declared size as a metric
// so the per-byte cost is derivable, and both are verified before the timed region to
// have taken the outcome they are meant to measure.
