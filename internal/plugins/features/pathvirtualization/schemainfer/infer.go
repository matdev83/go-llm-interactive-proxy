// This file implements the schema-assisted inference step: it turns one tool's
// declared argument schema into the canonical JSON Pointer argument selectors that
// the existing selector resolver can already use, and nothing else.
//
// The step is the third and last entry of the resolution order in design.md
// 210-214, which belongs to the profile-precedence task. What lives here is only
// the conservative candidate search it feeds: the step never decides which
// selector wins, never reads an argument value, and never touches a filesystem.
//
// Every candidate it publishes satisfies all of the following, and each rule is a
// separate refusal rather than a preference:
//
//   - the declared property name, in its normalized spelling, is in the bounded
//     path-key vocabulary (requirement 3.3);
//   - the declared name is not, and the declared description does not describe, a
//     payload concept (requirement 3.4, design.md 221-222);
//   - the declared shape is a string or a homogeneous array of strings
//     (requirement 3.3);
//   - the whole declared structure was readable, unambiguous, and free of a
//     repeated member name;
//   - the pointer is within the depth, pointer-count, and node-count bounds, and
//     the spelling is one the accepted pointer dialect itself accepts.
//
// Anything else yields zero selectors and one bounded reason (requirement 3.5,
// requirement 7.9). There is no partial answer: a tool that trips any bound or
// unverifiable structure publishes nothing at all rather than the subset that
// happened to be provable.

// MaxSchemaNodes bounds how many declared schema objects one inference call may
// inspect.
//
// Depth alone does not bound the work, because a schema can declare an unbounded
// number of sibling properties at one level. This is the same kind of fail-closed
// implementation contract as the selector bounds it complements, and it is what
// keeps one tool's traversal cost independent of how large a provider chose to
// spell its tool schema. A schema past the bound is refused, not truncated.
//
// This bounds the walk only. The read that precedes it is bounded separately, by
// the nesting-depth window in schema.go: the projection materializes only the
// declared levels the walk can still reach, which is at most
// pathvirtualization.MaxPointerDepth+2 levels deep, so the read is a constant
// multiple of the declared size rather than a function of declared nesting depth.
// Both bounds together are this feature's half of requirement 7.9 — the walk may
// visit at most MaxSchemaNodes declared objects, and may only ever visit objects
// within that window — layered on the canonical lipapi.MaxToolParametersBytes
// (256 KiB, pkg/lipapi/limits.go) that refuses an over-large declaration before a
// tool definition reaches this step at all.
