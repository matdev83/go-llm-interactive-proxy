package schemainfer_test

// Spec: b-leg-path-virtualization Task 11.1, requirements.md 9.2 and 9.3, and the prior
// finding this feature recorded about a quadratic parse cost in exactly this package:
// a 148-185 KB declared schema chain spent seconds because every declared level
// re-entered the decoder on its own full subtree.
//
// This file is the host-independent half of the standing guard. The existing deep-read
// cost test in this package pins the same property with a wall-clock budget and a
// scale-free deep-versus-wide parity factor; those are the right assertions for a
// one-order-of-magnitude regression, and they are left exactly where they are. What they
// cannot be is a guard that runs identically on a busy CI machine, so this file adds the
// complementary property in a form that has no time in it at all: ALLOCATION COUNTS,
// which are a deterministic function of the code and its input and therefore identical
// on every host and under every timing condition.
//
// The assertion is a RELATIVE one. Comparing the per-member allocation cost at 1000
// declared members against the per-member cost at 10 catches a cost that stopped being
// proportional to the declaration without freezing the absolute number, which would
// break every time the reader's internals legitimately change.
//
// The test does not call t.Parallel, and that is load-bearing rather than an oversight.
// testing.AllocsPerRun pins GOMAXPROCS to one and panics inside a parallel test, and its
// sample counts process-wide allocations, so a concurrent parallel sibling would be
// counted as if it were this test's own. The testing package runs serial top-level tests
// one at a time and releases parallel ones only afterwards, so a serial test here is
// measured on a quiet process.
