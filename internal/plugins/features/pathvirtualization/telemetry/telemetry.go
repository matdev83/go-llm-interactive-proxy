package telemetry

// This file is the recorder: the one mutable value in the package, and the only place
// a report's bounded content becomes a number.
//
// Two properties are structural rather than checked, and both are load-bearing:
//
//   - IT IS A CONSTRUCTED VALUE. There is no package state, no init() registration, and
//     no ambient hook, so a deployment that wants counters constructs a recorder and a
//     deployment that does not never has one. That is what makes "the feature's
//     observability is explicit" true rather than aspirational, and it is why the
//     composition seam is the only thing that can decide to observe at all.
//
//   - IT ACCUMULATES, IT NEVER OBSERVES. Nothing in this file reads a request, a call,
//     a payload, or a workspace. Both entry points take a report a component had already
//     decided to emit, which is what makes the recorder incapable of changing any
//     decision and safe to add to a safety-relevant feature.
//
// The concurrency contract is stated in the type's own doc because it is load-bearing:
// ONE recorder is shared by every retry, race participant, and failover candidate of a
// logical turn, since the bundle hands the same instance to all three of its components
// and the runtime holds those components for the whole generation. The mutex is the
// whole mechanism - the counters are otherwise plain integers, and every series is a
// fixed-size array indexed by a closed vocabulary, so recording allocates nothing and
// its memory does not grow with traffic.
