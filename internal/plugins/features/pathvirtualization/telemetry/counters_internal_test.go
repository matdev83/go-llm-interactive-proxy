// A tally array is declared to be one slot LARGER than the closed vocabulary it
// indexes, so that a value outside that vocabulary lands in a bounded slot whose
// label says the recorder did not recognise it. Sharing the last slot with the
// final genuine member is not a bounded fold: it publishes an unrecognised
// condition AS a specific one, which is the reading the array's own header calls
// out as unacceptable.
//
// These are in-package tests because the fold and the label projection are the
// unit under test: the published symptom is only visible through a snapshot, and a
// snapshot cannot distinguish "this build has a fifth outcome" from "this build
// mislabelled a hostile value as workspace_unresolved".
