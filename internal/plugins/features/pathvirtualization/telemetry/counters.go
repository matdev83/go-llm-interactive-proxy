// This file is requirement 7.6's counter surface and the arithmetic behind it.
//
// The counters requirement 7.6 names are eligible occurrences, rewritten occurrences,
// skipped occurrences by bounded reason, the byte accounting - bytes-before, bytes-after,
// bytes-saved - and the two failure counters, expansion failures and mandatory-buffer
// overflows. Every one of them is an integer here, and every dimension they break down by
// is a closed enum projected through its own String method.
//
// THE SAVING ARITHMETIC is the part that can be wrong in a way that flatters the feature,
// so it is stated once, here, and implemented once.
//
// Both directions replace a DECODED string value with another decoded string value, and
// the shared engine measures decoded-value lengths in both directions ([rewrite.Stats]).
// It measures DECODED lengths rather than raw wire lengths on purpose: the figure answers
// "how many bytes of value did the model stop seeing", and a client that spelled a path
// with escapes has the same value either way.
//
//	OUTBOUND. The replacement is the alias, and requirement 9.1 guarantees the alias is
//	strictly shorter than the real root it replaces. So before - after IS a saving, and
//	that is the figure requirement 9.5 asks an operator to be able to compute per request
//	and per turn.
//
//	INBOUND. The replacement is the real root, and the real root is necessarily LONGER than
//	the alias it replaced - the alias only ever existed because it was shorter. So before
//	- after is NEGATIVE, and a negative value is not a saving: expanding an alias back to a
//	real path COSTS bytes. That cost is reported as [InboundCounters.BytesGrown] rather
//	than folded into a saving figure, because the operator sizing a rollout needs to see
//	it and a "bytes saved" field is the wrong place to hide it.
//
// The two are never summed into one figure, and that is the substantive decision rather
// than a presentation one: summing them would report a deployment that virtualizes
// heavily as LOSING bytes on every expansion. That is arithmetically true and
// operationally useless - the inbound cost is the price of the outbound saving, paid on
// the client's side rather than the model's, and one net number would hide exactly the
// two facts an operator needs. [TotalCounters.BytesSaved] is therefore the OUTBOUND
// figure, documented as such rather than being a sum that happens to work out.
//
// Finally, no published saving is ever negative. Requirement 9.1 makes a negative outbound
// delta unreachable through the rewriter, but the projection does not DEPEND on that
// guarantee: clamping is one comparison, and a "bytes saved" field that could read negative
// would be the single most misleading number this package could publish.
