package telemetry_test

// This file is the RED half of the feature's content-free metrics/inventory
// projection, requirements.md 7.6, 7.7, 7.8 and 9.5.
//
// What is being pinned, in the order the requirements state it:
//
//   - 7.8 INVENTORY. Enablement, mode, and the bounded configuration shape come from
//     config.Resolved.Shape() and from nothing else. A tool name, a JSON Pointer, a
//     vocabulary key, and a project root are all operator input and all potentially
//     sensitive, so the inventory reports the SHAPE of a configuration and never its
//     content.
//
//   - 7.6 COUNTERS. Eligible occurrences, rewritten occurrences, skipped occurrences by
//     bounded reason, bytes-before, bytes-after, bytes-saved, expansion failures, and
//     mandatory-buffer overflows. Every one of those is either a count or a byte total,
//     and every dimension they are broken down by is a closed enum.
//
//   - 7.7 CONTENT FREEDOM. No real path, virtualized path suffix, payload byte, tool
//     name, tool-call ID, or high-cardinality hash may appear in any label, dimension,
//     or value. The hostile-payload case is the interesting one, because a benign
//     fixture cannot tell a bounded dimension from a content-bearing one.
//
//   - 9.5 REALIZED SAVINGS. An operator must be able to compute realized byte savings
//     per request/turn from what is recorded, and the figure must never be applied when
//     it is negative.
//
// The saving accounting deserves its own note before any test reads it, because it is
// the one number here that can be wrong in a way that flatters the feature. Both
// directions of this feature REPLACE a decoded string value with another decoded string
// value, and the shared engine measures DECODED-VALUE lengths in both cases. In the
// OUTBOUND direction the replacement is the alias, which requirement 9.1 guarantees is
// strictly shorter than the real root, so before - after is a genuine saving. In the
// INBOUND direction the replacement is the real root, which is necessarily LONGER than
// the alias it replaced, so before - after is NEGATIVE: expanding an alias back to a
// real path costs bytes rather than saving them. Summing both directions into one
// "bytes saved" figure would report a deployment that virtualizes heavily as losing
// money on every expansion, which is arithmetically true and operationally useless. The
// projection therefore keeps the two directions apart, records each one's own saving
// (clamped at zero because a negative value is not a saving), and exposes the raw
// before/after totals per direction so an operator can see the inbound cost rather than
// having it silently folded away.
