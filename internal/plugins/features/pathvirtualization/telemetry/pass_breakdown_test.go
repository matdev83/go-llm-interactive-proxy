// Spec: b-leg-path-virtualization Task 12.1, requirements.md 7.6, 7.7, 9.1 and 9.5.
//
// This file pins the PASS BREAKDOWN of the outbound tally: the bounded per-pass
// measurement dimension that makes an audit deployment's per-candidate realized saving
// recoverable instead of merely summed.
//
// The problem it answers is arithmetic, not cosmetic. In production both outbound passes
// observe ONE candidate. A REWRITE publishes the alias, so the late pass finds no real-root
// prefix and measures nothing. An AUDIT publishes nothing, so the late pass finds exactly
// what the early pass found and measures the same figure again: the measured ratio was
// exactly 2.00 in every fixture, and an operator reading the generation total could not
// recover the number a rewrite deployment would have realized without knowing how many
// passes re-measured. Requirement 9.5 asks for that figure to be CALCULABLE.
//
// Three properties are pinned, and the third is what makes the first two usable:
//
//	THE ROWS ADD UP TO THE TOTAL. The breakdown is a partition of the same measurement,
//	    not a second accounting: the rows sum to [telemetry.TotalCounters.PassObservedOpportunityBytes]
//	    exactly, so the headline figure cannot disagree with its own breakdown.
//	CARDINALITY IS BOUNDED AND THE LABELS ARE CLOSED. The series is a fixed-size array
//	    indexed by the pass vocabulary, an UNSTATED pass lands in its own row rather than
//	    being attributed to a real pass, and a value outside the vocabulary folds into a
//	    bounded slot that renders the vocabulary's own "unknown". Nothing keys on an
//	    input, so no amount of traffic can grow the series.
//	NO ROW IS EVER NEGATIVE. Each row clamps its own saving per observation, for the same
//	    reason the generation total does.
