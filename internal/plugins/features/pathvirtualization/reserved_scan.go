// This file adds the one alias-recognition question the parseable-path recognizer
// cannot answer: does a block of raw bytes that is NOT a path, and is not even
// readable as JSON, spell the fixed V1 reserved namespace at all?
//
// It is needed by exactly one caller. A completed tool-call argument document the
// runtime could not parse has no structure left to walk, so there is no path to hand
// to the parseable recognizer, and there is no selector resolution to tell a
// path-bearing field from a content field. design.md "Error Handling" nevertheless
// requires the closed answer: "a recognized applicable alias must never bypass
// required expansion and reach the client." The only way to recognize an alias in
// that state is lexically, over bytes.
//
// What this recognizer deliberately does NOT decide:
//
//   - the flavor. It answers "these bytes spell the reserved namespace", never
//     "these bytes spell a POSIX alias". The flavor of a mangled spelling is exactly
//     what the parseable path must resolve, and guessing it here would put a guess in
//     front of the only place that can prove it.
//   - the drive and the tag comparison against a mapping. Whether the alias names
//     THIS workspace needs a mapping, which a document may arrive before one can be
//     derived for.
//   - whether the alias is inside a field the operator configured as path-bearing.
//     That is not knowable without structure, which is why every caller of this
//     recognizer pairs it with the closed fail-closed policy its own state requires.
//
// It is a recognizer, not a second parser. The marker must be a COMPLETE path
// segment and the tag segment is validated by the same reservedWorkspaceTag rule the
// parseable path uses, so a real directory named `my.__lip_v1__` and a substring
// mention of the marker are both outside the namespace.

// A well-formed answer wins over a malformed one. Both are refusals for a caller that
