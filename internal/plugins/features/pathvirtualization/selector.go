// This file implements the explicit half of design.md 197-229: validated JSON
// Pointer selectors for path-bearing tool-call arguments and structured tool
// results, and the bounded limits that keep selector work finite.
//
// Explicit selectors are operator configuration, so they are validated once at
// configuration compile time and never again per request. The accepted dialect
// is the plain RFC 6901 string form with exactly one spelling per pointer: a
// pointer is absolute, its `~` escapes are complete, its tokens are non-empty, and
// it addresses an existing location by byte-exact reference name. Every rejected
// spelling returns its own bounded reason instead of being resolved by a guess.
//
// Resolution is deliberately shape-restricted. A selected location contributes
// leaves only when it is a string or an array whose every element is a string.
// An object, number, boolean, null, mixed array, or absent location is skipped
// with a bounded reason and yields nothing, so no arbitrary JSON string can ever
// be rewritten as if it were a filesystem locator (requirements 2.3, 3.1, 3.2,
// 3.5).
//
// Schema-assisted inference and profile precedence are deliberately absent: this
// file knows only about the selectors an operator spelled out, and it bounds the
// path-key vocabulary those selectors' inference step will consume.

// Selector bounds. They are fixed implementation contracts, not operator-tunable
// values: a configuration beyond a bound is refused rather than truncated, so
// every compiled selector set is finite and its per-document cost is bounded
// (requirement 7.9).
