// Spec: b-leg-path-virtualization Task 11.1, requirements.md 9.2, 9.3, 9.4 and 9.6,
// against design.md "Testing Strategy / Benchmarks" and "Observability".
//
// This file measures the outbound half of the feature over growing occurrences:
// requirement 9.4's "selector-guided argument rewriting" and its "representative
// path-oriented result rewriting", design.md's "Idempotent second outbound pass", and
// the 10/100/1000 occurrence request fixtures design.md asks for.
//
// The two roots and their lengths are the requirement 9.6 fixtures: a deep synthetic
// POSIX monorepo worktree root of 151 bytes and a long synthetic Windows drive worktree
// root of 220 bytes, whose occurrence paths are 187 and 256 bytes respectively. The
// Windows figure matters most here: 256 bytes is four under MAX_PATH, so the
// 1000-occurrence tier is a real long-path measurement rather than a short-path one in
// disguise. Every fixture root lives under `/synthetic/` or `C:\synthetic\`, every
// benchmark name is a fixed label, and no benchmark prints a path, an alias, a workspace
// tag, or a document.
//
// Fixtures are built before the timed region and nothing inside a benchmark body
// touches the filesystem, the clock, or an RNG. No benchmark asserts on elapsed
// time: the stable guard against a reintroduced super-linear cost is in
// occurrence_scaling_test.go and is expressed in allocations.

// timed loop on purpose: entering the loop resets the extra metrics the testing
// package prints, so a metric set before the loop is silently dropped. The unit
// spelling carries no slash for the same reason the tier does not: the testing package
// parses the printed line on slashes and discards a metric whose unit contains one.
