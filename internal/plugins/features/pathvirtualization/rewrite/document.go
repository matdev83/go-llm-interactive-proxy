package rewrite

// This file implements the payload half of the rewriter: it applies one compiled
// selector set to one canonical JSON payload and returns the replacement bytes.
//
// The engine is a byte splice, not a re-encode. A selected leaf is replaced in
// place, inside the exact bytes of its own JSON string literal, and every other byte
// of the payload is carried across untouched. That is what makes requirement 2.8
// hold literally: member order, number spelling, string escapes, whitespace, and
// empty-versus-null presence all survive, and a payload that was never selected is
// returned as the same bytes rather than a normalized equivalent. It also makes
// reapplication safe, because a payload that already carries the alias produces no
// match at all and therefore no bytes.
//
// Selection authority stays where the spec put it. The compiled selector set is
// resolved by the lexical core, which enforces the whole-document pointer refusal
// and the all-or-nothing string, string-array, object, and mixed-array rules, and
// this file never re-implements any of them. It only locates the leaves that core
// published and asks the mapping what each value means as a path locator.
