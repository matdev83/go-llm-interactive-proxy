package rewrite

// This file owns the bounded, content-free outcome of one rewrite. Everything a
// caller may learn about what the rewriter did is a count, a byte total, or one
// reason from a closed vocabulary: no path, suffix, tool name, call ID, pointer
// text, or digest can reach a log line or a metric attribute through these types
// (design.md 252).
//
// The vocabulary is closed and total on purpose. A condition this step can observe
// has exactly one reason, so an accounting stage never has to guess why a surface
// contributed nothing, and an unobserved condition cannot invent a new label. The
// four selector reasons are the canonical selector layer's own reasons, projected
// one to one, so the same refusal reads identically wherever it is reported.

// SkipReason is the bounded, content-free reason one surface contributed no
// rewrite.
//
// It is an enum because the value only ever reaches fixed-count observability
// dimensions. The whole set is closed: SkipReasonNone is the no-skip value and never
// appears in a published statistics value, and every other member is a condition
// this step can actually observe.

	// for every surface of the call (requirement 1.4). It is recorded once per call
	// rather than once per surface, because the whole call shares that one state and
	// reporting it per surface would imply a per-surface decision that never
	// happened.
	SkipReasonMappingInactive
	// SkipReasonNoSelectors marks a tool-call argument surface or a structured
	// result surface that no exact profile claimed and the optional inference step
	// did not prove path-bearing, so nothing was selected (requirements 3.5, 3.8).
	SkipReasonNoSelectors
	// SkipReasonPayloadAbsent marks a surface that carries no payload: the field is
	// empty, or it is the JSON null literal. Absent and null are the same answer
	// here because a null payload names no location at all, and the field's own
	// absence is preserved rather than materialized.
	SkipReasonPayloadAbsent
	// SkipReasonPayloadInvalid marks a payload that is not one complete JSON value.
	// A payload that cannot be read whole is never read partially.
	SkipReasonPayloadInvalid
	// SkipReasonPayloadNotObject marks a payload that is present and readable but
	// whose root is not an object. A JSON Pointer can only name a member of an
	// object, so an array or scalar root has no selected location.
	SkipReasonPayloadNotObject
	// SkipReasonSelectorUnresolved marks a pointer that names no location in this
	// payload: an absent member or array position, a token below a scalar, or a
	// position outside the array. The canonical selector layer refuses it, and the
	// rewriter repeats the refusal without guessing at a nearby location.
	SkipReasonSelectorUnresolved
	// SkipReasonSelectorNotString marks a selected value that is neither a string
	// nor an array of strings: a number, a boolean, or null.
	SkipReasonSelectorNotString
	// SkipReasonSelectorObject marks a selected object. Its own nested strings are
	// not selected, because descending into arbitrary structure is the recursive
	// rewrite requirement 2.3 forbids.
	SkipReasonSelectorObject
	// SkipReasonSelectorNotStringArray marks an array holding at least one element
	// that is not a string. The whole array is refused rather than partially
	// selected, so a rewritten payload can never keep an unrewritten path element
	// beside a rewritten one.
	SkipReasonSelectorNotStringArray
	// SkipReasonOpaqueResultUnchanged marks an opaque result payload that no exact
	// profile marked path-oriented, which therefore stays byte-for-byte unchanged
	// (requirement 2.5). It covers the item-authoritative Output, a legacy
	// PartToolResult text payload, and a text result content part.
	SkipReasonOpaqueResultUnchanged
	// SkipReasonOpaqueResultBounded marks an opaque result payload that an exact
	// profile DID mark path-oriented and that the bounded recognizers still left
	// byte-for-byte unchanged. That is the honest answer whenever nothing in the
	// payload is unambiguously a location: the declared mode ran, found no line it
	// could prove, and reported the refusal rather than guessing at a text rewrite
	// (requirement 2.6, design.md 246-250). A payload the recognizers accepted
	// records no skip at all, and that includes a payload accepted on some of its
	// lines and refused on others: the surface, not the line, is this step's unit,
	// and a refused line contributes no counters either, so a partially accepted
	// payload is reported through its counts alone rather than as a refusal.
