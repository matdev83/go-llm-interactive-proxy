package rewrite

// This file owns the reusable half of the payload engine: applying one compiled
// selector set to one canonical JSON payload and replacing the values the caller
// decides about, as a byte splice.
//
// It exists as an exported primitive for exactly one caller, the inbound expansion
// pass of design.md "7. Path Expansion Finalizer", and it exists because that pass
// must satisfy the SAME byte-for-byte property the outbound direction does. Task 4.1
// proved member order, duplicate keys, number spelling, escapes, whitespace, and
// empty-versus-null presence survive a rewrite because the mutation is a splice
// inside each selected string literal rather than a re-encode. Requirement 4.8 then
// asks the inbound direction for that same property. A second implementation of the
// splice would put it at the mercy of whichever copy drifted first, so there is one
// copy and both directions call it.
//
// What the primitive deliberately does NOT own is the decision. It never asks what a
// value means, never decides whether a value is a location, and never invents a
// refusal: the caller answers those per leaf through a ValueDecider, and this file
// only guarantees that exactly the leaves a compiled selector published are visited,
// in ascending byte order, exactly once each.
//
// The refusal semantics are the one thing it does enforce structurally, because
// getting them wrong is a security defect rather than a measurement drift: the FIRST
// refused leaf ends the pass and the payload is not published at all. A partially
// expanded argument document would hand the client one decided path beside one
// undecided alias, which is exactly the outcome design.md "Error Handling" forbids.
