package rewrite

// This file implements the conservative result handling of design.md 246-250: the
// two bounded recognizers behind the two enabled OpaqueResultMode values, applied
// only to an opaque tool-result payload whose exact tool profile explicitly asked
// for them.
//
// The rule is one sentence: a line of the payload is rewritten only when EVERY
// whitespace- or comma-delimited token on it is a path this mapping accepts, and
// then exactly those tokens are replaced. A line carrying anything else is left
// byte-for-byte alone.
//
// That rule is chosen for one reason: the only failure mode that matters here is a
// false positive. An opaque tool result is exactly the payload requirement 2.4 and
// requirement 3.3 refuse to inspect for paths, so its text is very often source, a
// diff, a shell command line, a log line, a stack frame, an embedded JSON blob, or
// prose that merely MENTIONS a workspace path. All of those put at least one token
// on the line that is not a path, so the whole line is refused instead of a path
// being pulled out of the middle of it. What survives is a line that holds nothing
// but locations, which is the only shape both enabled modes are defined over.
//
// Three further decisions follow from the same priority:
//
//   - recognition is per LINE, never per free-floating substring. A path glued to an
//     identifier, a path inside a quoted source string, and a path behind a diff
//     context marker are all mid-token or mid-line, so none of them can be a line
//     that holds nothing but locations;
//   - quotes, brackets, colons, equals signs, and every other byte are ordinary
//     token bytes, never delimiters. A delimiter set that let a key-value or quoted
//     shape be split would make `path=/ws/a.go`, `"path":"/ws/a.go"`, and
//     `grep -n hit /ws/a.go` recognizable, and those are the exact shapes of
//     strace, journalctl, git, grep, and log output this step must not touch;
//   - ambiguity fails closed everywhere. A single token that is not a path refuses
//     its whole line, an unrecognized mode recognizes nothing, and a line that
//     already mixes the alias namespace with the real root is refused, which is
//     what keeps reapplication stable instead of oscillating (requirement 2.9).
//
// The two enabled modes differ only in how many tokens a line may hold:
// path_tokens accepts one or more, matching its declared contract of "a list of
// locations, one or more per line", while path_lines accepts exactly one, matching
// its declared contract of "whole lines that hold nothing but a location". The
// line-mode recognizer is therefore a strict subset of the token-mode recognizer,
// and both share this one tokenizer and this one mapping call.
//
// Cost and purity are structural rather than checked: one pass over the payload to
// decide line by line, a second pass only over the lines that were accepted, no
// regular expression, no backtracking, no recursion, and at most one allocated
// output buffer. The step holds no state, performs no I/O, and delegates every
// prefix decision to Mapping.VirtualizePath, so path flavor semantics (POSIX
// case-sensitivity, Windows ASCII case-insensitivity, separator equivalence, and the
// segment-boundary rule) are the lexical core's answers rather than a second
// implementation of them.
