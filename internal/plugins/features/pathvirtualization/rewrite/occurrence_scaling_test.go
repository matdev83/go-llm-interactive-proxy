// Spec: b-leg-path-virtualization Task 11.1, requirements.md 9.2, 9.3 and 9.4, and the
// two prior findings this feature recorded about a quadratic parse cost: the standing
// guard that a super-linear cost cannot come back silently.
//
// Benchmarks are measurements and cannot gate anything. These tests are the guard, and
// they are expressed in ALLOCATIONS for one reason: an allocation measurement is a
// deterministic function of the code and its input, so it is identical on every host,
// on every CPU, and under every timing condition, while a wall-clock threshold is
// none of those things. A relative-scaling assertion is used rather than an absolute
// count, because the absolute count legitimately moves whenever the byte-splice
// internals change, whereas a growth factor between two input sizes only moves if the
// cost stops being proportional to its input.
//
// Two measurement units appear below, and the split is not stylistic. The occurrence
// guards and the DEPTH guard are expressed in allocation COUNT where a count can see
// the defect, and the depth guard's own unit is chosen by measurement: rebuilding one
// pointer path per nesting level adds about one allocation per level but roughly thirty
// times the BYTES, so a count would show a 10% difference and pass while the pass
// allocated half a gigabyte. See the depth guard for the numbers and for why it
// measures allocated bytes.
//
// Both kinds of assertion are deliberately LOOSE. Each compares the per-occurrence (or
// per-level) allocation cost at the largest tier against the cost at the smallest and
// allows a factor of two. Linear cost passes with a factor near one; a reintroduced
// quadratic passes with a factor of about 100, far outside a bound of two while leaving
// ordinary implementation churn plenty of room.
//
// None of these tests calls t.Parallel, and that is load-bearing rather than an
// oversight. testing.AllocsPerRun and runtime.ReadMemStats both pin or read
// process-wide allocation state, so a concurrent parallel sibling would be counted as
// if it were this test's own. The testing package runs serial top-level tests one at a
// time and releases parallel ones only afterwards, so a serial test here is measured on
// a quiet process.

// The DEPTH guards below are the second recorded finding of the same family: the walk
// that locates selected leaves rebuilt the complete JSON-Pointer text of every container
// it opened, at every nesting level, including inside subtrees holding no selected leaf
// at all, and every open frame retained its own text. One nesting level therefore cost
// the length of every reference token above it, so a valid document well inside the
// 1 MiB argument bound could allocate hundreds of megabytes and grow quadratically in
// its own nesting depth rather than in its size.
//
// The measurement unit is ALLOCATED BYTES, not allocation count, and that is a measured
// choice rather than a stylistic one. The defect adds roughly one allocation per nesting
// level (the retained path string) on top of the decoder's own ~10 per level, so an
// allocation COUNT moves from ~11.1 to ~10.1 per level: a ten percent difference that any
// sane tolerance would wave through, while the BYTES move from ~31,700 to ~990 per level
// on the fixture below, a factor of thirty-two. runtime.ReadMemStats.TotalAlloc is used
// for the same reason the sibling reserved-scan guard uses it: it is a monotonic
// cumulative byte total, so a collection happening at any point inside the measured
// region cannot change it, unlike a live heap reading.

// depthSegmentName pads each nesting level to roughly a hundred bytes.
//
// The name length is the point of the fixture: a quadratic path cost is proportional to
// the reference tokens ABOVE a level, so a short member name hides most of it. At
