// Spec: b-leg-path-virtualization Task 12.1, requirements.md 9.3 and 9.4, against
// design.md "Existing Architecture and Placement" and "Testing Strategy / Benchmarks".
//
// This file is the regression guard for the production performance defect Task 11.1
// measured and reported: the walk resolved a tool's policy once per OCCURRENCE rather than
// once per distinct name, so a tool no profile layer claims had its declared argument
// schema re-read and re-walked on every occurrence. At 1000 occurrences of one unclaimed
// tool that measured 223.0 against 62.0 allocations per occurrence - a 3.6x amplification,
// flat per occurrence, i.e. linear in (occurrences x declared-schema size).
//
// Four properties are pinned, and the third is what makes the first two mean something:
//
//	ONE RESOLUTION PER NAME PER PASS. Repeated occurrences of one tool name consult the
//	    policy once and every one of them is still rewritten: the count is asserted
//	    against published aliases, so a resolver that answered nothing for everything
//	    could not satisfy it.
//	THE MEMO IS PER PASS, NOT PER PROCESS. Two walks over two calls consult it twice, so
//	    nothing can be carried from one request into the next. Requirement 2.3's
//	    no-mutable-mapping rule is about the ROOT mapping and this is a different thing,
//	    but a cross-request cache of derived policy answers would still be a mutable
//	    store, so the scope is asserted rather than assumed.
//	NO SELECTOR SEMANTICS CHANGE. Every surface of a mixed-policy fixture rewrites to
//	    exactly the bytes and statistics it produces when carried alone in its own call.
//	    That is the property a memo can silently break, and it is checked against the
//	    REWRITER'S OWN output rather than against a restatement of the resolution order.
//	THE TWO RESOLUTION SITES STAY INDEPENDENT. A tool call offers its declared schema to
//	    the resolution; a tool result offers none. One walk that sees a call and a result
//	    for the same name must resolve both, so a memo keyed on the name alone - which
//	    would hand the result surface the call surface's resolution - is refused.
