package rewrite

// This file fuzzes the opaque-result recognizer with untrusted payload bytes. The
// properties it pins are the ones a false positive would violate, and they have to
// hold for every byte sequence, valid text or not:
//
//   - the recognizer never panics, and a payload it refuses is returned as the very
//     same string rather than a copy;
//   - anything it publishes is what a line-level rewrite would produce, so the
//     published bytes never grow: the alias is always shorter than the prefix it
//     replaces;
//   - reapplication changes nothing, so the idempotent request-part hook can run
//     this rewriter over its own output;
//   - the statistics agree with the bytes: a published payload reports at least one
//     rewrite, and a refused one reports none.
//
// The seed corpus is deliberately the false-positive shapes rather than only the
// accepted ones, because a fuzz input only ever finds a bug if it can reach the
// accepting branch by accident.
