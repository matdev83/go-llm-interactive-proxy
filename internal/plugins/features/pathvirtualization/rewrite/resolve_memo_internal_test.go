package rewrite

// Spec: b-leg-path-virtualization Task 12.1, requirements.md 9.3 ("audit/rewrite
// processing shall be bounded in CPU and memory by canonical payload limits and
// feature-specific selector/profile limits") and 9.4.
//
// The per-pass resolution memo removes a per-occurrence amplification, and it introduces
// the only memory this walk ever holds that grows with its input: one entry per distinct
// tool name the walk resolves. That number has to be bounded, because a call's tool names
// are model-emitted and therefore attacker-chosen, and because the legacy message authority
// can carry far more parts than the item authority's occurrence cap.
//
// Two facts are pinned here rather than argued in a comment:
//
//	THE MEMO STOPS AT ITS BOUND. A walk over more distinct names than the bound holds
//	    resolves every name, and the surplus resolutions are simply not cached. Dropping
//	    the cache changes no answer - it only costs the repeated work the memo exists to
//	    avoid - so the bound is a memory guarantee rather than a correctness one.
//
//	THE SHARED REWRITER CARRIES NO MEMO. One Rewriter serves every request of a
//	    generation, so a memo held on it would be a cross-request store of derived policy
//	    answers. Reflection reads the struct rather than trusting a comment, so a field
//	    added later fails this test instead of quietly becoming one.
