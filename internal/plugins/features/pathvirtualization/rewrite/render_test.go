// This file pins requirements.md 7.7 at the serialization boundary of the shared
// engine's own vocabulary: the per-surface skip tally requirement 7.6 asks to be
// counted "by bounded reason" must reach any exporter as the closed-vocabulary label,
// never as the ordinal an integer-coded enum otherwise renders as.
//
// The out-of-vocabulary value is included because it is the case a healthy build never
// produces and the one that must still degrade: an integer that escapes the process
// carries no label a reader can act on, whereas "unknown" is a bounded, actionable
// answer and keeps the exporter's cardinality at the size of the vocabulary plus one.
