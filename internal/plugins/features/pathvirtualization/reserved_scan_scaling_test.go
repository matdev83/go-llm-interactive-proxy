package pathvirtualization_test

// Spec: b-leg-path-virtualization, review finding P1 #3: the lexical reserved-alias
// recognizer copied the ENTIRE remaining payload into a string once per marker
// occurrence, so its cost grew quadratically in the occurrence count and reached
// hundreds of megabytes on a payload inside the 1 MiB argument bound the assembler
// enforces.
//
// This file is the standing guard against that cost coming back. It is expressed in
// ALLOCATED BYTES for the same reason the outbound rewrite guard
// (rewrite/occurrence_scaling_test.go) is expressed in allocations: an allocation
// total is a deterministic function of the code and its input, so it is identical on
// every host, under every timing condition, and inside whatever GC state the process
// happens to be in, while a wall-clock threshold is none of those things.
//
// TWO ASSERTIONS, deliberately separated in strength:
//
//   - TestScanReservedAliasAllocationsStayBoundedOverManyMarkers is an ABSOLUTE
//     bound on one realistic many-marker payload. It is the one that would fail on a
//     reintroduced quadratic copy, and its slack is orders of magnitude below the
//     measured cost so ordinary implementation churn cannot trip it.
//   - TestScanReservedAliasAllocationsScaleWithOccurrenceCount is the RELATIVE
//     analogue of the outbound occurrence guard: per-occurrence cost must not grow
//     with the occurrence count. It is loose by design, exactly like its sibling.
//
// Neither test calls t.Parallel. runtime.ReadMemStats pins a process-wide allocation
// total, so a concurrent sibling's allocations would be counted as this test's own.
// The testing package runs serial top-level tests one at a time, so a serial test is
// measured on a quiet process.
//
// NOTHING HERE PRINTS CONTENT. Fixture bytes are synthetic filler and the reserved
// marker, and no assertion message carries a path, an alias, a workspace tag, or a
// tool-call id.
