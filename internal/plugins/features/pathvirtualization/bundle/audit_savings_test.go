package bundle_test

// Spec: b-leg-path-virtualization Task 11.2, requirements.md 7.3, 7.6, 7.7, 9.1 and
// 9.5, against design.md "Observability" and "Configuration and Composition".
//
// This file is the OPERATOR-FACING half of the audit mode. The rewrite package's own
// audit suite (rewrite/audit_test.go) and the parity probe it added (rewrite/
// parity_probe_test.go) already prove that two rewriter instances agree about one
// payload. That is not the claim an operator sizing a rollout needs. The claim is that
// the numbers a measured deployment publishes - the ones an operator reads to decide
// whether to switch the mode - are the numbers the mutating deployment would have
// realized. So every assertion here is made through the SHIPPED composition seam
// (config.Decode -> bundle.FeatureBundleWithTelemetry -> telemetry.Snapshot) rather
// than through a rewriter a test constructed for itself. A drift between the two
// would then have to be a drift in the wiring, which is the only place one could
// survive the rewrite package's coverage.
//
// Three properties are pinned, and the third is what makes the first two mean
// something:
//
//	7.3  AUDIT MEASURES WHAT REWRITE WOULD DO, EXACTLY. For one identical input, the
//	     audit-mode snapshot and the rewrite-mode snapshot carry the same eligible
//	     count, the same replacement count, the same decoded byte totals, and the
//	     same byte saving - equality, not proximity - across both canonical
//	     authorities, several occurrence counts, three path flavors, and a case with
//	     no eligible leaf at all.
//	7.3  AUDIT PUBLISHES NOTHING. The call each pass was handed comes back
//	     byte-identical, on the same backing arrays, with the attempt decision
//	     carrying no reason code. Without this the equality above could be a
//	     coincidence of two passes that both happened to measure zero.
//	9.1  NO NEGATIVE SAVING IS EVER PUBLISHED. The inbound direction replaces an
//	     alias with a LONGER real root, so its delta is negative by construction;
//	     the published figure is a growth figure or zero, never a negative saving,
//	     and a delta that somehow went the wrong way is clamped rather than reported.
//
// 7.7 is asserted against hostile content in BOTH modes rather than in one, because
// the mode is the only thing that changes between them and a leak introduced by a
// mode branch would be invisible to a single-mode check.
//
// EVERY ASSERTION MESSAGE IN THIS FILE IS CONTENT-FREE. Names are bounded tokens,
// and the numbers reported are counts, byte totals, and bounded labels. No failure
// message interpolates a path, an alias, a workspace tag, a tool name, a JSON
// Pointer, or an argument document - including the fixtures' own bytes, which would
// otherwise be the one way this suite could publish what it exists to prove is never
// published.
