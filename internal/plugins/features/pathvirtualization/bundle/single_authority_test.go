package bundle_test

// This file pins the ONE-authority rule at the strongest level available: the
// bundle's own construction site. Both outbound passes must consume the SAME
// compiled policy resolver, because a bundle that constructed a second resolver for
// it would let the early pass and the late pass disagree about which surface is
// path-bearing. Two workspace tags inside one request is exactly the shape
// requirements.md 5.6 forbids, and Task 5.2's composition constraint records it as
// the one disagreement this feature can still cause.
//
// The workspace half of that rule is now stronger than "one shared instance": this
// package holds NO workspace authority at all. The runtime pins one per logical turn
// and projects it onto both stages the two passes read, so the second half of the
// check is that nothing here manufactures, wraps, or chains one.
//
// The check is structural because identity is not observable from outside the
// package: the passes hold their policy resolver in unexported fields, and a
// behavioral test cannot distinguish "one shared instance" from "two equal
// instances" - two separately compiled resolvers would answer identically. Reading
// the construction site is therefore the only way to make the rule falsifiable, and
// it fails the moment a second construction, a second compile, or a locally
// manufactured workspace chain appears.
