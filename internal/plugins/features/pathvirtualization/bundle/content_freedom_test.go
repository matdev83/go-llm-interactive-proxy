package bundle_test

// This file pins requirements.md 7.7 at the bundle boundary: no path, alias,
// workspace tag, tool name, pointer, or argument byte the bundle handles may reach
// an observable surface.
//
// The bundle is the last place operator content is in scope, because it is the only
// place all three of it coexist - a compiled policy resolver that holds exact tool
// names and JSON Pointers, a project-root-derived alias, and complete tool-call
// arguments. Its contribution surface is deliberately dull for that reason:
//
//   - the only values it can refuse on are the SDK's plane-contribution errors and
//     the expansion constructor's bound refusal, and both carry bounded text;
//   - it installs exactly ONE reporter per component, and that reporter is the
//     feature's own content-free recorder rather than anything this package composes;
//   - and it emits no log line, no metric, and no error of its own.
//
// The identity strings below are exactly the content an observable surface would
// leak: a fixed low-cardinality label is safe, a workspace root or an alias is not.
//
// THIS FILE USED TO ASSERT THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT IT ASSERTS NOW, and the change is worth
// recording because the assertion had to be REWRITTEN rather than relaxed. It read
// TestTheBundleRegistersNoReporter and structurally proved that none of the three
// constructors was passed a reporter, on the reasoning that a reporter installed here
// would be a metric dimension this package controls and a later edit could make
// content-bearing. That reasoning was right and the conclusion is now INVERTED, because
// requirements.md 7.6 and 7.8 ask this feature for counters and an inventory, and
// requirements.md 7.7's obligation is discharged by WHAT those counters contain rather
// than by the feature having none. A feature that observes nothing cannot leak
// observation data, but it also cannot let an operator answer "is this on, in which mode,
// and what is it saving" - which is the question 7.8 exists for.
//
// So the replacement asserts three things instead of one:
//
//  1. the SAME structural exactness, now in the affirmative: each constructor is called
//     with its full declared arity PLUS exactly one reporter option, and the reporter
//     argument is a fixed expression rather than something assembled from content;
//  2. that the one reporter is the feature's recorder and not a closure this package
//     builds - because a locally composed closure is exactly the thing that could
//     capture a root, an alias, or a tool name and attach it as a label later; and
//  3. the behavioural opposite of the old test: driven with hostile content, the
//     installed reporter records observations, and every one of them is bounded.
