// The feature's reachability lever is its own typed configuration, not a process
// flag, and this file pins that at the level where a flag would have to appear.
//
// The classification matters enough to state. Task 9.2 is BEHAVIORAL: the feature
// becomes reachable in stock composition, which is precisely why a flag would be
// attractive - an operator-visible kill switch for a rollout that mutates outbound
// requests. The repo's own precedent is that every other behavioral task in this
// specification declined it (5.3, 6.1, 6.2, 7.1, 7.2, 8.1, 8.2, 9.1), and this file
// checks that the decline is real rather than assumed.
//
// The reason is that requirements.md 7.1 already provides the lever, in the right
// place and with better semantics. The `enabled` key under the feature's own
// subtree is read at generation-compilation time, so turning it off produces a
// generation that publishes NOTHING - not one that runs a pass which checks a
// boolean and returns early. That distinction is the whole argument:
//
//   - a flag checked inside a pass leaves the pass in every request and every
//     completion, so the "off" state still costs the hot path and still shows up in
//     inventory;
//   - a configuration key removes the participant from the plane set, so the off
//     state is genuinely absent, and the diagnostic inventory shows it as absent
//     rather than as present-and-disabled;
//   - a process flag is not scoped to a generation, so it cannot express "this
//     generation has it off" at all, and a reload could race a request against it.
//
// A flag would also be a service-locator-shaped global, which the repo's
// construction rules forbid outright, and it would put rollout state somewhere no
// configuration audit can see.
//
// The check is structural for the same reason the shared-authority check is: a
// process flag is a call to a package-level accessor, and asserting its absence at
// runtime would mean asserting that a global is not being consulted, which no
// behavioral test can distinguish from "it is consulted and happens to be false".
