package outbound

// This file implements the feature's second outbound pass: the idempotent
// request-part hook of design.md "Existing Architecture and Placement" step 4, which
// reapplies the SAME pure canonical rewriter after the later request shaping that sits
// between the candidate attempt stage and the backend-bound request.
//
// The pass exists because the early pass alone cannot satisfy requirements.md 5.2 and
// 5.4. It virtualizes eligible history before candidate sizing, context eligibility, and
// token-accounting preflight observe it, which is requirement 5.3. But the runtime
// then does more work on the same candidate before Backend.Open: post-hook rederivation
// (step 5), the final conversation-view reassertion (step 6), clamps and backend-ingress
// accounting (step 7), and candidate adaptation (step 8). Any of those can put a
// real-root path back onto a path-bearing tool surface, and the per-turn buffer (step
// 9) plus Backend.Open (step 10) would then carry the real path to the backend.
// requirements.md 5.4 forbids exactly that, and this pass is the last writer that can
// prevent it.
//
// Its whole design is one sentence, and it is the same sentence the early pass is
// built from: read the authoritative workspace view the runtime already pinned for the
// turn, derive the workspace-bound mapping from it with the core's pure DeriveMapping,
// run the one pure rewriter in the generation's rollout mode, publish what it
// published, and fail open to the real path if it did not finish. Everything a reader
// might expect to find here and does not is a deliberate absence:
//
//   - no second rewriter, and no second mapping rule. Both passes call the same
//     rewrite.Rewriter with the same mapping, so a surface one pass claims is a surface
//     the other claims (design.md 233). That identity is why reapplication is
//     idempotent: the rewriter publishes a byte splice that only fires on a
//     segment-boundary real-root prefix, so an already virtualized call produces no
//     match and therefore no bytes;
//   - no workspace authority. The workspace view is READ from the projection the
//     runtime pinned for the turn rather than resolved here, so this pass holds no
//     resolver at all and cannot mint a second, competing one;
//   - no state. The mapping is re-derived from the authoritative view on every
//     invocation rather than cached, which is what makes requirement 5.6's "same alias
//     for every retry, race participant, and failover candidate of one logical A-leg
//     turn" true with no synchronization, and what makes requirement 6.2's
//     restart-equivalence true by construction;
//   - no routing decision and no candidate influence. The pass reads no route field, no
//     candidate identity, and no backend identity, and requirements.md 5.5 puts all of
//     those outside this feature's reach. It also cannot exclude a candidate: the
//     request-part interface has no way to say so;
//   - no returned error. Every condition it can meet is either a bounded report or a
//     silent no-op, so the request-part chain always continues.
//
// On failure the pass publishes NOTHING, exactly like the early pass. That is stronger
// than the rewriter's own contract, which returns the input call on error: this pass
// does not write back at all, so even a hypothetical rewriter that handed back a
// half-rewritten call alongside its error could not get one published. A request is
// either the value the runtime built or the fully published rewrite of it.

// The rollout mode and the compiled policy are the same two values the early pass
// takes, and there is deliberately no third authority argument. sdkhooks.PartMeta
// carries TraceID, ALegID, BLegID, AttemptSeq, and BackendID and no workspace view, so
// the workspace has to arrive by some other route; the runtime pins one per logical turn
// and projects it onto the public SDK context seams alongside session, scope, and
// principal (internal/core/execctx.WithViews), and this pass READS that projection
// through [workspace.WorkspaceViewFromContext].
//
// Reading the pinned snapshot rather than resolving is what makes requirement 5.6 hold
// by construction rather than by luck. The early pass reads the same pinned view out of
// its request.AttemptMeta.Workspace, so the two passes cannot disagree about which
// workspace a request belongs to no matter what the resolver chain would have answered
// later - the shape a live re-resolution produces is two workspace tags in one
// backend-bound request. Because the projection is a plain context value, nothing is
// resolved per attempt here, and requirement 6.2's restart-equivalence follows from the
// derivation being a pure function of the pin.
//
// An absent projection is accepted and means "no workspace authority was published". It
// is not an error, and it is reported as the unresolved-workspace condition rather than
