package outbound

// This file implements the candidate attempt transform itself: the feature's first
// outbound pass at design.md "Existing Architecture and Placement" step 2.
//
// The design of the pass is one sentence: derive the mapping from the authoritative
// workspace projection, run the one pure canonical rewriter in the generation's
// rollout mode, publish what it published, and fail open to the real path if it did
// not finish. Everything a reader might expect to find here and does not is a
// deliberate absence:
//
//   - no routing decision. The pass reads no route field, no candidate key, no
//     backend or model identity, and no retry ordinal, and it always answers
//     request.AttemptContinue with no reason code. requirements.md 5.5 puts route
//     identity, model and backend selection, B-leg sequencing, output commitment,
//     retry/failover authority, billing authority, and secure-session authority
//     outside this feature's reach, and an attempt transform that returned anything
//     other than AttemptContinue would be exercising candidate choice, which is
//     exactly what it must not do;
//   - no state. The mapping is re-derived from the workspace projection on every
//     attempt rather than cached, which is what makes every retry, race participant,
//     and failover candidate of one logical A-leg turn derive the same V1 alias
//     (requirement 5.6) with no synchronization, and what makes the alias identical
//     after a process restart (requirement 6.2);
//   - no second rewriter. This pass calls the same rewrite.Rewriter every other
//     outbound pass calls, with the same mapping, so the audit numbers it reports
//     are the rewrite's own numbers (requirement 7.3).
//
// On failure the pass publishes NOTHING. That is stronger than the rewriter's own
// contract, which returns the input call: this pass does not write back at all, so
// even a hypothetical rewriter that handed back a half-rewritten call alongside its
// error could not get one published. A candidate is either the value the runtime
// built or the fully published rewrite of it.
