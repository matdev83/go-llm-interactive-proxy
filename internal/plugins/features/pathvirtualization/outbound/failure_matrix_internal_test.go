package outbound

// This file owns the two rows of the b-leg-path-virtualization FAILURE POLICY MATRIX that
// no runtime turn can reach, and it is the other half of
// internal/core/runtime/path_virtualization_failure_policy_matrix_test.go.
//
// Requirements 8.2 and 8.3. Design sections: "Error Handling" ("no pinned workspace view:
// nothing is published, the real path survives, and a bounded reason is recorded";
// "unexpected outbound transformation failure before alias exposure: fail open to the real
// path with bounded diagnostics") and "Testing Strategy / Runtime-integration".
//
// WHY THESE TWO ROWS LIVE HERE AND NOT ONLY IN THE RUNTIME TABLE
//
// The matrix is ONE table and it lives in the runtime file, because a policy a reader has
// to reconstruct from six files is not a policy. Two of its rows are driven here, and the
// reason is structural rather than a matter of convenience:
//
//   - an ABSENT pinned workspace view ([OutcomeWorkspaceUnresolved]). The runtime always
//     projects one: it deliberately projects an EMPTY view on the detached auxiliary path
//     precisely so both passes have an authority to read and refuse, and requirement 1.8
//     then decides that an empty root is unusable. There is no turn in which the late pass
//     finds no authority at all, so producing that condition means handing the shipped pass
//     a context that never went through the projection.
//   - an UNEXPECTED transformation error ([OutcomeTransformationFailed]). The shared
//     rewriter's error path is documented as unreachable from untrusted input - it can only
//     be a disagreement between two decoders over bytes that already decoded as one valid
//     JSON value - and the pass reaches it only through its declared rewriter port, which
//     is package private by design.
//
// Neither is worth a synthetic end-to-end harness, and a second end-to-end harness is
// exactly what this package's test discipline forbids. So both conditions are driven on
// the REAL shipped passes, and the runtime table's rows for them carry the same bounded
// reason read from the same production enum, which is what keeps the two halves from
// drifting.
//
// WHAT IS ADDED ON TOP OF THE EXISTING PER-PASS PROBES
//
// attempt_internal_test.go and part_internal_test.go already prove each pass's own
// fail-open branch. What a matrix ROW has to pin, and a single pass's probe cannot, is:
//
//   - both passes on the SAME input and BOTH canonical authorities, so the row says the
//     outbound DIRECTION fails open rather than one pass happening to;
//   - that no partially virtualized document escapes on either surface. Each pass's own
//     probe offers one partially rewritten publication; here the failure is offered on a
//     call carrying two surfaces in BOTH authorities at once, which is the shape that would
//     put a real path and a virtual alias on one backend-bound request;
//   - that the shared engine reports no statistics for work it never published, so a
//     failed turn can never read as a successful rewrite in requirements.md 7.6's counters;
//   - and, for the absent-authority row, that the two passes do not CONFLATE their two
//     different "no mapping" facts under one label.
//
// CONTENT FREEDOM
//
// No failure message here contains a path, an alias, a workspace tag, a tool-call ID, a
// tool name, or argument bytes. Documents are compared and never printed; messages carry
// requirement numbers, bounded reason labels, occurrence counts, and byte totals only.
//
// DETERMINISM
//
// One fixed project root, one content-defined mapping derivation, one fixed partially
// rewritten publication, no map iteration on any compared surface, and no clock or RNG.
