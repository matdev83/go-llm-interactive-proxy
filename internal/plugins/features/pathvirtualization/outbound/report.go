package outbound

// This file owns everything a caller may learn about what one outbound pass did.
//
// The whole reporting surface is two values: a closed outcome enum and the shared
// rewriter's content-free statistics. Both are needed and neither may grow a
// content-bearing field, because this is a candidate-level record of a pass that ran
// against untrusted client payloads.
//
// The vocabulary is closed on purpose, and it is closed differently from the
// rewriter's. The rewriter's twelve SkipReason members describe PER-SURFACE
// refusals inside one successful walk: which selector was unresolved, which payload
// was absent. This file's Outcome describes what happened to the PASS as a whole,
// which is a different axis and cannot be expressed as one of those: a call whose
// every surface was refused is still a pass that ran, and a pass that failed before
// it walked anything skipped no surface at all.
//
// The one member that has no counterpart in either existing vocabulary is
// OutcomeTransformationFailed. It is required rather than convenient, and it is
// required by requirements.md 8.2, which asks for a bounded reason specifically when
// outbound virtualization meets an internal error before an alias becomes
// model-visible. DeriveMapping's SkipReason already covers every unusable-root case
// (requirement 1.8's enumeration), so this file adds no new root code: it projects
// that closed set as Report.RootReason rather than widening it.
//
// OutcomeWorkspaceUnresolved is the second such member, and it exists for the same
// reason with a narrower reach. Only the late pass resolves the workspace view at all:
// the early pass reads an already-pinned projection, so a resolution failure is a
// condition the early pass cannot observe and the late pass must account for. Reporting
// it as OutcomeProjectRootUnusable would be a false label - the root is not unusable,
// the authority that would have supplied it failed - and reporting it as
// OutcomeTransformationFailed would borrow a label the transformer's own doc binds to
// the shared rewriter, which never ran. Requirement 8.2 asks for a bounded reason, and
// the honest way to provide one is one more member of a still-closed vocabulary rather
// than a mislabelled existing one.
//
// Nothing here is ever formatted from a payload. Every label is a compile-time
// literal, and every counter comes from the shared rewriter, whose accounting is
// bounded by the closed reason vocabulary and by canonical payload limits
// (requirements.md 7.6, 7.7).

	// code is carried in Report.RootReason (requirement 1.8).

	// OutcomeTransformationFailed marks a pass that hit an unexpected internal
	// transformation failure before any alias could have become model-visible.
	//
	// This is the fail-open condition of requirements.md 8.2. The candidate is left
	// exactly as the runtime built it, so the real path reaches the backend, and the
	// reason is recorded here instead of being turned into an exclusion: an internal
	// error in an optional optimization must never cost a client its request.
	OutcomeTransformationFailed
	// OutcomeWorkspaceUnresolved marks a pass that published nothing because the
	// authoritative workspace view could not be resolved at all, so there was no
	// project root to derive a mapping from.
	//
	// Only the late pass can reach it: the early pass reads an already-projected
	// workspace view out of its attempt metadata, while this pass resolves the view
	// itself at the request-part stage. Requirement 8.2 still applies - the real path
	// is preserved and a bounded reason is recorded - but the reason is not a root
	// shape refusal, so Report.RootReason stays at its no-refusal value here.

// vocabulary and the same content-free statistics for both - so a deployment that
