package outbound_test

// This file pins requirements.md 7.7 at the SERIALIZATION boundary of the outbound
// report. A report is documented as safe to "log, export, or use as a metric
// dimension", and json.Marshal is the most likely exporter a deployment reaches for,
// so the rendered bytes are part of the feature's observable surface rather than an
// implementation detail of Go's encoder.
//
// The property is that EVERY enum dimension renders as a BOUNDED STRING. It is not
// enough that the in-process String() is bounded: an integer-coded enum serializes as
// a raw number, and a number is unbounded in the only sense that matters here - a
// future member, or a value this build does not define, exports as whatever the
// ordinal happens to be, and an ordinal carries no label an operator can act on. The
// test therefore pins the RENDERED form, not the String method, and it pins the
// out-of-vocabulary case separately because that is the one a healthy build never
// produces and the one that must still degrade.
