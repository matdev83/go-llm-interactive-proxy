package expansion

// This file owns the bounded, content-free vocabulary of one expansion decision.
//
// There are three vocabularies here and none of them may carry a path, an alias, a
// workspace tag, a tool name, a pointer, or argument bytes, because every one of them
// can reach a log line, a metric label, or the client-facing refusal the assembler
// builds from a finalizer's ReasonCode (requirements.md 7.7, 7.8):
//
//   - Reason is this package's own decision vocabulary. It is a NEW closed set rather
//     than a reuse of two existing ones, because no existing axis describes this pass.
//     The outbound rewriter's SkipReason describes PER-SURFACE refusals inside one
//     successful walk, and the lexical core's ExpandResult describes what a single path
//     means. What a caller needs here is what happened to one completed tool call, and
//     that is a third axis with a third answer set.
//   - Outcome is the pass-level shape of that answer, and it is three members because
//     requirement 7.6 asks for eligible/rewritten/skipped/rejected-style accounting and
//     nothing more. Every member is a condition this pass can actually observe.
//   - Report carries those two plus the shared engine's content-free statistics and the
//     lexical core's own bounded root refusal, reusing that closed vocabulary unchanged
//     so requirement 1.8's enumeration stays the single authority on why a root is
//     unusable.
//
// The labels are design.md "Observability"'s own vocabulary wherever one exists:
// workspace_mismatch, malformed_reserved_alias, selector skip, and mandatory overflow
// all appear there verbatim. Report deliberately has NO error field, for the same
// reason the outbound report has none: a Go error's text is the one thing in this
// feature that could carry a payload byte, and there is no reason a caller needs it
// when a closed reason says the same thing.
//
// Nothing in this file is ever formatted from a payload. Every label is a compile-time
// literal, and every counter comes from the shared engine, whose accounting is bounded
// by its own closed reason vocabulary and by the canonical payload limits
// (requirement 7.9).

	// ReasonNoSelectors marks a decision that inspected nothing, because no exact

	// tool having at least one argument selector.

	// ReasonPayloadNotObject marks arguments that are readable but whose root is not a

	ReasonMappingInactive
	// ReasonArgsUnparseable marks a decision that failed the call closed because the

	// the fixed V1 reserved alias namespace, for a tool whose policy names at least one
	// argument location. design.md "Error Handling" requires exactly this: existing
	// repair policy may run first, but a recognized applicable alias must never bypass
	// required expansion and reach the client (requirements.md 4.4, 8.3).
	ReasonArgsUnparseable
	// ReasonMalformedReservedAlias marks a decision that failed the call closed because
	// a selected value spelled the reserved marker at an alias-root position and was not
	// followed by the frozen tag segment. Such a value is never expanded and never
	// handed back as an ordinary client path (requirement 4.4).
	ReasonMalformedReservedAlias
	// ReasonWorkspaceMismatch marks a decision that failed the call closed because a
	// selected value spelled a well-formed reserved alias that does not name the current
	// mapping: another project root's tag, an incompatible flavor, another drive, or a
	// mapping with no active alias. It is requirements.md 6.5's stale-workspace
	// outcome, and it is never expanded against the current root.
	ReasonWorkspaceMismatch
	// ReasonInvalidRewrite marks a decision that failed the call closed because the
	// spliced document did not survive the JSON validation design.md section 7 step 9
	// requires. A splice of a decoded document cannot break the grammar, so this is a
	// defensive invariant rather than a reachable state; it exists because requirement
