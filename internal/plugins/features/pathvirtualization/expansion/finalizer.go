// This file implements design.md "7. Path Expansion Finalizer" step for step.
//
// The eleven numbered steps of the design are, in this file's order:
//
//	 1. derive the current Mapping from meta.Workspace.ProjectRoot           -> decide
//	 2. resolve selectors using the exact tool name and current tool schema -> resolve
//	 3. if there are no selectors, pass                                     -> Finalize
//	 4. parse completed ArgsJSON                                            -> expand
//	 5. visit selected leaves only                                          -> expand
//	 6. parse a V1 reserved alias form before any expansion                 -> expandPath
//	 7. if the alias matches the current VirtualRoot, use the RealRoot      -> expandPath
//	 8. reject a malformed alias or a different tag/flavor/drive           -> expandPath
//	 9. validate the rewritten JSON and bound it against the canonical delta limit -> publish
//	10. the assembler synthesizes the canonical rewritten lifecycle         -> ActionRewrite
//	11. existing tool policies/reactors receive real paths                  -> design step 10
//
// Steps 6 through 8 are not re-implemented here. The lexical core's
// Mapping.ExpandPath already performs reserved-alias recognition BEFORE ordinary
// prefix matching and already answers with exactly the three states step 8 needs, so
// this file's decider is a projection of that answer onto the pass's own vocabulary
// and nothing more. That delegation is deliberate: a second reserved-alias decision
// is exactly the kind of drift that would let a stale alias rebind.
//
// Two properties are structural rather than checked:
//
//   - the mapping is DERIVED per call from the authoritative view and never cached, so
//     a changed root derives a different workspace tag on the very next call and an
//     alias a provider retained across the change fails closed (requirements.md 6.1,
//     6.5);
//   - the mutation is the shared byte splice, so requirement 4.8's "preserve JSON
//     validity and all non-selected argument fields" holds literally rather than by
//     re-encoding.
//
// The one place this file adds a rule of its own is the UNPARSEABLE-DOCUMENT
// REFUSAL, and it exists because design.md "Error Handling" demands it: when repair
// has declined to complete a malformed argument document, there is no structure left
// to walk and therefore no way to ask the selector layer which field was
// path-bearing. Releasing those bytes would release a possibly-alias-bearing argument,
// so a document that carries the fixed V1 reserved namespace is refused instead. The
// refusal is narrow on purpose - it needs the reserved marker at a segment boundary,
// the tool's own policy must name at least one argument location, and a document with
// no marker keeps requirement 4.7's pass-through - and the accepted residual it
// cannot avoid is documented on the decider itself.
//
// The second rule of its own is the OUTPUT BOUND of step 9. Syntax validity is the
// half of canonical validation that costs nothing to check; the size half is the half
// expansion itself can break, because the alias it substitutes is short by construction
// and the real root is not. The bound used is the runtime's own canonical delta limit
// rather than a limit invented here.
