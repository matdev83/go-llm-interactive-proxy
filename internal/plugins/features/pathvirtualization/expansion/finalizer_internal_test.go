// The canonical-validity check on a published document is a DEFENSIVE invariant:
// a splice of a decoded document cannot break the grammar, so no input reaches the
// branch that applies it. That is exactly why its ordering has to be pinned here
// rather than left to the reachable paths.
//
// The defect this pins is an accounting one. Finalize recorded the decision and
// only THEN re-labelled it for an invalid document, so one decision produced two
// reports: the first published the refused call as a successful expansion -
// decision.outcome derives OutcomeExpanded from `published != nil`, so the byte
// counters and the eligible/rewritten tallies were recorded for a call that was
// released as nothing - and the second published the refusal it actually was. The
// one-report-per-decision contract is stated on Reporter, and the fail-closed cases
// are precisely the ones whose accounting an operator has to be able to trust.
//
// The test is in-package because the branch is unreachable through Finalize, which
// is the whole point: there is no input that makes decide return an invalid
// document. The ordering is therefore only observable as the property of the step
// that performs it.
