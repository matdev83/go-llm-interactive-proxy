package expansion_test

// Spec: b-leg-path-virtualization Task 11.1, requirements.md 9.2, 9.3, 9.4 and 9.6,
// against design.md "Testing Strategy / Benchmarks" (completed-call expansion) and
// "Observability".
//
// This file measures the INBOUND half: the completed-tool-call expansion finalizer of
// design.md section 7, over the 10/100/1000 occurrence fixtures, on both long
// requirement 9.6 roots.
//
// The measurement is of the whole pass, not of one step inside it, because the whole
// pass is what a deployment pays: the per-call mapping derivation (SHA-256 workspace
// tag included), the exact-name selector resolution, the shared byte splice, and the
// published-document validation of design.md section 7 step 9. A step-wise benchmark
// would let the most expensive step be measured in isolation and would never show that
// the inbound direction re-derives the mapping on every completed call.
//
// Fixtures are synthetic and built before the timed region. The alias spelling is
// derived from the fixture root rather than hard-coded, the roots live under
// `/synthetic/` and `C:\synthetic\`, and no benchmark prints a path, an alias, a
// workspace tag, or a document. No benchmark asserts on elapsed time.
