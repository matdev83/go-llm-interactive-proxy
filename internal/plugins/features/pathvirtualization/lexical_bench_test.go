package pathvirtualization_test

// Spec: b-leg-path-virtualization Task 11.1, requirements.md 9.2, 9.3, 9.4 and 9.6,
// against design.md "Testing Strategy / Benchmarks" and "Observability".
//
// This file measures the lexical core in isolation: flavor recognition (requirement
// 9.4's "path parsing"), mapping derivation including the SHA-256 workspace-tag
// derivation every outbound and inbound pass pays for, and the two prefix
// operations the whole feature rests on.
//
// Three rules govern everything below.
//
// Fixtures are synthetic and built before the timed region. Every root here is
// spelled under `/synthetic/` or `C:\synthetic\`, and no benchmark prints a root,
// an alias, or a workspace tag: the only names that appear in benchmark output are
// the fixed labels in benchRootForms. That is requirement 7.7's content-freedom
// rule applied to measurement output, not only to production observability.
//
// The roots are LONG on purpose. A short root is a SUPPORTED root whose alias is
// correctly not strictly shorter than the root itself, which leaves virtualization
// inactive by requirement 1.4, so a short fixture would measure the inactive path
// and prove nothing. The Windows drive root is 220 bytes, so an ordinary source-file
// path under it reaches 256 bytes, four under MAX_PATH; the POSIX root is a deep
// monorepo worktree path of 151 bytes, reaching 187 with the same suffix.
//
// No benchmark asserts on elapsed time. These are measurements; the stable guard
// against a reintroduced super-linear cost lives in rewrite/occurrence_scaling_test.go
// and is expressed in allocations, which are host-independent.
