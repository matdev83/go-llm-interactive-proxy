package config

// This file is the operator configuration surface of the B-leg path
// virtualization feature, and it owns the fail-closed half of requirements.md
// 7.5: an invalid selector, a duplicate or conflicting exact profile, an
// unsupported bound, or an ambiguous configuration is refused as a WHOLE at
// generation compilation, so a request can never resolve a selector, a bound, or
// a mode that was not validated.
//
// Four decisions shape everything here, and each of them is a requirement rather
// than a preference:
//
//  1. DISABLED BY DEFAULT, AND NOTHING CONSTRUCTS. An absent subtree, an empty
//     document, an explicit null, an empty mapping, and an `enabled: false`
//     mapping all decode to an inert resolution with no resolver, so a stock
//     deployment builds no attempt transform, no request-part hook, and no
//     expansion finalizer. Validation still runs, because an unusable value in a
//     parked configuration is the kind of thing that becomes an unpublishable
//     generation the moment somebody flips the switch.
//
//  2. NO ALIAS-MARKER OR VERSION OVERRIDE. The reserved alias namespace, its
//     version, and the workspace-tag encoding are fixed implementation
//     contracts (requirement 7.4), so the decoder reads exactly the six
//     design.md top-level keys and refuses anything else. There is consequently no key that
//     could move the reserved alias namespace, change the workspace-tag encoding,
//     or name a pattern: the surface does not exist to configure, and the marker
//     literal itself appears nowhere in this package's production sources, which
//     its own test proves byte for byte.
//
//  3. EVERY BOUND IS VALIDATED BY ITS SINGLE DEFINITION. The configurable
//     mandatory-expansion range is `toolcall.BufferingSpec.Validate`, the
//     selector and profile rules are `pathvirtualization.CompileToolProfiles` and
//     `CompilePathKeys`, the path-key normalization is `schemainfer.New`, and the
//     exact-name lookup is `pathvirtualization.NewResolver`. This file re-derives
//     none of them; it decides only which of their verdicts becomes which
//     Reason, and it refuses the whole configuration when any of them refuses.
//
//  4. THE MODE IS EXPLICIT AND NEVER A ZERO VALUE. `rewrite.Mode`'s zero value is
//     audit, so a configuration that spelled no mode must not become audit by
//     arithmetic. An enabled subtree therefore REQUIRES the key: an absent mode
//     is the ambiguous configuration requirement 7.5 names, and defaulting it
//     either way is wrong - to audit it would silently measure a rollout the
//     operator asked to mutate, and to rewrite it would mutate without an
//     opt-in. This does not conflict with requirement 7.1, because disabled by
//     default is decided at the enabled gate and a deployment that never enables
//     the feature never reaches this rule.
//
// The mandatory bound is the fifth decision worth naming, because it is the one
// that is easiest to get silently wrong. `mandatory_max_args_bytes` is a
// POINTER, so an absent key is distinguishable from an explicit zero, and an
// explicit zero is refused rather than read as "unset". A completeness
// requirement that silently degrades to the default is not a smaller bound; it
// is a deployment that believes it enforces a limit it is not enforcing.
//
// The compiled result, Resolved, carries no operator text at all: only bounded
// counts and the compiled policy. That is what lets requirements.md 7.8's
// diagnostics inventory report the configuration SHAPE without exposing a
// pointer, a tool name, or anything path-shaped.
