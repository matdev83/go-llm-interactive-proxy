package config

// This file owns the bounded classification of a rejected configuration and the
// single error type that carries it.
//
// The design is the same one the rest of this feature uses for its decision
// vocabulary: an error is a CLOSED SET OF LITERAL LABELS plus a fixed
// configuration LOCATION, never text derived from what the operator wrote.
// `toolcallrepair` and several other features interpolate the offending value
// into their messages, which is fine for a value that is either a small enum
// spelling or a key name. It is not fine here, because the values a path
// virtualization subtree can carry include tool names and JSON Pointers, and a
// configuration error is precisely the string an operator pastes into a bug
// report, into a CI log, and into a ticket tracker.
//
// So every byte an Error can render is chosen at compile time:
//
//   - the reason label, which is a member of a closed enum;
//   - the location, which names one of a fixed set of configuration paths and is
//     never assembled from an operator's key.
//
// requirements.md 7.7 forbids real paths, virtualized suffixes, payloads, and
// high-cardinality hashes in anything a deployment can observe, and 7.8 asks
// for a diagnostics inventory of the bounded configuration SHAPE. A reason code
// plus a fixed location is exactly that: an operator can find the offending key
// among the six the design permits, and nothing they typed can travel.
//
// The selector/profile/path-key dimension is NOT duplicated here. It already has
// a closed, content-free vocabulary in the lexical core
// (pathvirtualization.SelectorReject), so an Error carries one of those rather
// than a second set of overlapping reasons that could disagree with it.

// Reason is the bounded, content-free classification of a refused
// path-virtualization configuration.
//
// It is a closed enum because it only ever reaches fixed-count observability
// dimensions, an operator-facing classification, and a test assertion. It never
// carries a path, an alias, a workspace tag, a tool name, a pointer, or a payload
// byte: every String below returns a compile-time literal, and an integer this
// build does not define degrades to a bounded label rather than rendering
// something it was handed.

	// ReasonUnknownKey marks a top-level key outside the closed design set. It is
	// the refusal that makes requirement 7.4 structural: because the decoder

	// reserved alias namespace, its version, the workspace-tag encoding, or a
	// pattern surface this build does not have.
	ReasonUnknownKey
	// ReasonUnknownProfileKey marks a key inside one declared tool profile that is
	// outside the closed design set. The same argument as ReasonUnknownKey, one
	// level down: an operator profile is the place a namespace or pattern knob
	// would otherwise be tempting.
	ReasonUnknownProfileKey
	// ReasonMissingMode marks an enabled configuration that spells no mode. It is
	// a refusal rather than a default, and the reasoning is on DecodeConfig: the
	// two modes are not equivalent, so guessing one would either disable a
	// rollout the operator asked for or mutate without an opt-in.
	ReasonMissingMode
	// ReasonUnknownMode marks a mode spelling outside the closed audit|rewrite
	// enum. It is refused rather than read as audit, so a near miss such as
	// "Rewrite" cannot silently measure instead of mutating.
	ReasonUnknownMode
	// ReasonMandatoryBound marks a declared mandatory expansion bound the shared
	// SDK validator refuses. The range has exactly one definition
	// (toolcall.BufferingSpec.Validate) and this reason carries no number, so the
	// rejection text cannot leak the value an operator wrote.
	ReasonMandatoryBound
	// ReasonSelector marks a refusal owned by the shared exact-name profile and
	// resolver validators. SelectorReject carries which rule was broken.
	ReasonSelector
	// ReasonPathKeySelector marks a refusal owned by the shared path-key
	// vocabulary validator. It is a DISTINCT reason from ReasonSelector because
	// the two own different configuration keys: a profile rule names
	// `.tool_profiles` and a vocabulary rule names `.path_keys`, and one reason
	// cannot carry two locations.
	ReasonPathKeySelector
	// ReasonMalformedValue marks a value whose YAML type is not the declared
	// field's type. The decoder's own type error names the offending value, so
	// it is translated rather than wrapped.
	ReasonMalformedValue
	// ReasonMalformedProfile marks a `tool_profiles` value that is not a profile
	// mapping at all. It is a DISTINCT reason from ReasonMalformedValue for the
	// same reason the vocabulary has its own: the refusal is about a declared
	// profile, so it names `.tool_profiles` rather than the subtree root.
	ReasonMalformedProfile
	// ReasonRepairOrder marks the cross-feature composition guard's refusal: a
	// generation in which tool-call repair's effective finalizer order would sort
	// at or after the path-expansion finalizer's declared order. Requirements.md
	// 8.4 asks mandatory expansion to receive valid completed JSON, and that
	// clause cannot hold in such a generation.
	ReasonRepairOrder
	// ReasonAmbiguousRegistration marks a generation the guard cannot decide
	// because more than one enabled registration claims a guarded feature.
	ReasonAmbiguousRegistration
	// ReasonRepairConfigUnreadable marks a repair subtree this build cannot
	// decode. Its effective order is then unknown, and an unknown order cannot be
	// proven to sort before the expansion pass, so publication is refused.
	ReasonRepairConfigUnreadable
	// ReasonSelfConfigUnreadable marks a path-virtualization subtree this build

	// publication by asking the guard about a configuration it could not compile.
