# The repository layout is a constraint, not a convention: `<container>/branches/`
# holds the long-lived checkouts and `<container>/worktrees/` holds task worktrees.
# The commit-time layout guard rejects anything else, which means a wrong path is
# discovered only after the work is done. This script moves that failure to the
# moment of creation, before anything is written.
#
# Dry-run is the default; --apply explicitly authorizes creation.
# Everything is validated first: destination, branch, base, repository identity
# and worktree ownership. Only then does git run. The only action beyond creating
# the worktree is the layout guard, which proves the result satisfies the rule
# that would otherwise stop the commit.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 validated dry run, created, or an identical worktree already exists
#   1 refused: a validation failed (nothing was created)
#   2 usage error
