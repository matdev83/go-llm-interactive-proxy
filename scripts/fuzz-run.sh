# fuzz-run.sh — run a single `go test -fuzz=...` invocation and tolerate the
# Go fuzz engine's known spurious "context deadline exceeded" failure that
# occurs when -fuzztime expires (golang/go#75804, Go 1.25-1.26.x).
#
# At the -fuzztime boundary the fuzz coordinator cancels in-flight iterations
# and may emit:
#     --- FAIL: FuzzX (Ns)
#         context deadline exceeded
# with NO `file:line` reference and NO "Failing input written to" corpus entry.
# That is the time budget expiring, not a real test failure.
#
# Real failures always include either a `..._test.go:<line>:` (or any
# `*.go:<line>:`) reference or a "Failing input written to" line; those are
# still surfaced as failures. Only the bare deadline message is tolerated.
#
# Usage: fuzz-run.sh <args passed to `go test -fuzz=...`>
# Env:  GO — go binary (default: go)
