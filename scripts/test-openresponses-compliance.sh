# test-openresponses-compliance.sh - OpenResponses full-path compliance suite (Task 8.5).
#
# Proves the ACTUAL pinned official OpenResponses compliance suite on the full
# independent deployment (official JS client -> OpenResponses frontend -> core ->
# generic OpenResponses backend -> independent refbackend origin), separately
# from the Go-native mirrors, plus the direct independent-emulator wire suites,
# the 45-cell FE*BE conformance matrix (Task 8.5), and the emulator boundary
# architecture gates.
#
# With `-static` it runs only the fast Task 8.5 wiring/evidence gate used by
# `make qa`: it verifies the compliance scripts, the Makefile target wiring, and
# the docs reference exist, then runs the default-build evidence validators and
# emulator boundary gates. It deliberately does NOT re-run the huge tagged
# conformance/integration suites (which `make qa`'s qa-tests already covers) and
# does NOT require a JavaScript runtime, so the release gate is wired into qa
# without recursively duplicating test work.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/test-openresponses-compliance.sh [-static]
# Env:   GO          - go binary (default "go")
#        GO_TEST_FLAGS - extra go test flags (default "-parallel=8 -timeout=10m")
