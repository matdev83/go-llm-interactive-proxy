error: refusing to commit on '$branch'.

  $branch is a merge receiver: it receives squashed pull-request merges and
  authors nothing. Committing here puts a change on the integration branch
  without review, which is the outcome the worktree layout exists to prevent.

  Create a worktree branch and commit there:

    git -C $container/branches/main worktree add \\
      -b fix/short-description $worktrees_dir/fix-short-description origin/main

  The path must be absolute and must sit directly under $worktrees_dir/.
  A relative path resolves against the current directory and lands the new
  worktree inside branches/main, where the layout guard rejects it later.

  Maintainers who must commit here can set LIP_ALLOW_MERGE_RECEIVER_COMMIT=1
  for a single command.
