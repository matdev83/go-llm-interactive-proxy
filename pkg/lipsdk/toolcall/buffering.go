// delta, above which no bound could ever be honored.

// declaration does not name one.

// all.
//

// it receives narrows that scope with the separate optional

// It exists because a declared bound is a statement about the calls a finalizer
// must decide COMPLETELY, not about every call that happens to arrive on the
// same chain. A finalizer that inspects only operator-selected argument
// locations of one tool decides nothing at all about a call to another tool, so
// a consumer that applies such a declaration to every call would enforce - and
// potentially refuse - calls its declarer never claimed.
//
// It is deliberately NOT part of [Finalizer] or [BufferingRequirement], so every
// already-shipped implementation keeps compiling. A finalizer that does not
// implement it keeps the conservative answer: its declared requirement applies
// to EVERY call it is invoked for, which is exactly the pre-existing
// interpretation of a [BufferingSpec] and the one direction requirements forbid
// weakening.
//
// The answer must be derived from the three arguments and from nothing else. In
// particular it must not depend on request state, on the assembled argument
// bytes, or on anything a per-call decision varies, because the consumer reads
// it BEFORE the arguments are complete in order to decide how much of the call
// to buffer at all:
//
//	if appl, ok := f.(toolcall.BufferingApplicability); ok {
//	    if appl.ToolCallBufferingApplies(call.ToolName, tool, catalog) {

//	    }

// a tool name, a tool definition, and a catalog, and nothing about any concrete
// feature, payload domain, or target namespace.
