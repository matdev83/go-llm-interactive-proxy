// plugins, alongside [github.com/matdev83/go-llm-interactive-proxy/pkg/lipsdk/session.WithSessionView],
// [github.com/matdev83/go-llm-interactive-proxy/pkg/lipsdk/scope.WithScope], and
// [github.com/matdev83/go-llm-interactive-proxy/pkg/lipsdk/execview.WithPrincipal], and it
// exists because a plugin reached at a stage whose own metadata carries no workspace
// view otherwise has no sanctioned way to read the authoritative project root: the SDK
// offers [Resolver] for a stage that may RESOLVE, and a projection for a stage that may
// only READ what the proxy already decided.
//
// The attached value is a PINNED snapshot, not a resolution instruction. Reading it
// cannot reach a host, run an I/O boundary, or observe a project root other than the one
// the proxy already projected for this request, so two participants reading the same
// context cannot disagree about which workspace a request belongs to.
//
// A nil parent is treated as [context.TODO], so the result is always non-nil, and the
// view is cloned so a later mutation of the caller's maps or slices cannot change the
// stored snapshot.

// so a consumer can tell "no authority" apart from "an authority with nothing in it".
