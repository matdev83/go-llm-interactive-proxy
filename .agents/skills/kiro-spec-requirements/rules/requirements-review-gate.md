# Requirements Review Gate

Before writing `requirements.md`, review the draft requirements and repair local issues until the draft passes or a true scope ambiguity is discovered.

## Boundary Continuity

Use boundary terminology consistently across phases without turning requirements into design:

- **Discovery** identifies `Boundary Candidates`
- **Requirements** make inclusion, exclusion, and adjacent expectations explicit when scope could be misread
- **Design** turns those into `Boundary Commitments`
- **Tasks** use `_Boundary:_` to constrain executable work

Requirements should clarify the feature boundary in user- or operator-observable terms, not in architecture ownership or implementation detail.

## Slice Review

Run this first; it decides how much the rest of the review has to cover. Budgets and default deferrals live in `.kiro/steering/delivery.md`.

- The draft describes one V1 slice: the smallest change that delivers observable value and degrades safely.
- Every requirement is needed for the V1 slice to deliver its value. Anything that only makes the feature more durable, more distributed, more observable, or reachable through a secondary path moves to `Deferred` unless the user asked for it.
- Requirements state product behaviour. Testing, certification matrices, regression gates, and architecture ratchets are not requirements; remove them.
- A substrate feature names its first consumer.
- If the slice still exceeds the budget, propose a split to the user instead of writing the requirements.

## Scope and Coverage Review

- The draft must cover the V1 slice's core user journeys, scope boundaries, and primary error cases that are visible to the user or operator.
- If the feature touches adjacent systems, specs, or workflows, the draft must make clear what this feature expects from them and what it does not own when that distinction affects user-visible behavior or operator expectations.
- Business/domain rules, compliance constraints, security/privacy expectations, and operational constraints that materially shape user-visible behavior must be reflected explicitly when they are in scope.
- If coverage is missing because the draft is incomplete, repair the draft and review again.
- If coverage cannot be completed cleanly because the project description or steering context is ambiguous, contradictory, or underspecified, stop and ask the user to clarify instead of guessing.

## EARS and Testability Review

- Every acceptance criterion must follow the EARS rules defined in `ears-format.md`.
- Every requirement must be testable, observable, and specific enough that later design and validation can verify it.
- Remove implementation details that belong in `design.md` rather than `requirements.md`.
- Requirement headings must use numeric IDs only; do not mix numeric and alphabetic labels.

## Structure and Quality Review

- Group related behaviors into coherent requirement areas without duplicating the same obligation across multiple sections.
- Make inclusion/exclusion boundaries explicit when the feature scope could otherwise be misread.
- Keep boundary statements lightweight and observable: describe feature responsibility and adjacent expectations without prescribing components, layers, or internal ownership.
- Ensure non-functional expectations remain user-observable or operator-observable; move technology choices and internal architecture detail out of requirements.
- Normalize vague language such as "fast", "robust", or "secure" into concrete user-visible expectations whenever the source material supports it.

## Mechanical Checks

Before applying judgment, verify these mechanically:
- **Budget**: At most 5 requirement areas and 25 acceptance criteria. Count them.
- **Deferred section present**: `V1 Slice` and `Deferred` sections exist and are filled in.
- **Numeric IDs present**: Every requirement heading has a numeric ID (1, 1.1, 2, etc.). Scan the draft for headings without IDs.
- **Acceptance criteria exist**: Every requirement has at least one EARS-format acceptance criterion. Scan for requirements with no "When/If/While/Where" acceptance statements.
- **No implementation language**: Scan for technology-specific terms (database names, framework names, API patterns) that belong in design, not requirements. Flag any found.

## Review Loop

- Run mechanical checks first, then judgment-based review.
- If issues are local to the draft, repair the draft and re-run the review gate.
- Keep the loop bounded: no more than 2 review-and-repair passes before escalating a real ambiguity back to the user.
- Write `requirements.md` only after the review gate passes.
