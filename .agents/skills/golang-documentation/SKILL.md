# Go documentation

Use this skill when documenting a Go package, application, or release. Documentation is part of the API: derive claims from code and tests, state version/platform constraints, and keep examples runnable. Do not publish source, examples, Playground snippets, telemetry, or private package metadata without explicit authorization and a disclosure review.

## Focused review

For a review, keep the work read-only unless fixes are requested. Establish the review base, supported versions, and relevant contract; inspect changed code plus the callers and tests needed to assess it. Stay within this skill’s lens.

- Compare every changed behavioral claim with its implementation and callers: nil/zero inputs, concurrency, ownership, errors, cancellation, default configuration, and compatibility.
- Compile/run complete examples using the supported Go/dependency versions. Verify outputs and commands exercise the intended API rather than merely compiling.
- Inspect generated documentation, build-tag coverage, versioned release links, and copyable install/config steps against actual artifacts and tooling.
- Distinguish stale or missing caller-critical contracts from optional prose polish; propose the smallest correction and keep private examples within their authorized destination.

Report each actionable finding with severity, confidence, file/symbol, trigger, consequence, and smallest remedy. Separate introduced/worsened defects from pre-existing debt, and state executed checks versus inference. If none survives validation, say so and identify coverage gaps.

## Start with the audience

Identify whether the reader is an API consumer, operator, contributor, or maintainer. Inspect the public package names, exported symbols, commands, configuration, supported Go versions, and existing docs before writing. Prefer a short task-oriented page over a copied API dump. Keep project-specific policy in the repository docs rather than inventing universal Go rules.

## Doc comments and examples

- Document public packages and exported APIs with useful comments. Usually begin symbol comments with the identifier; grouped constants/variables may share an explanatory group comment with individual contracts where needed.
- Explain behavior, invariants, ownership, cancellation, errors, concurrency, and compatibility—not the spelling of the declaration.
- Document nil, empty, zero, and invalid-input behavior when callers can observe it.
- Use `ExampleName` and `ExampleType_Method` tests for executable documentation. Keep examples deterministic, bounded, and free of credentials or private endpoints; include `// Output:` only for stable output.
- Run `go test ./...` and inspect rendered docs with `go doc` or a local documentation server. `go vet` can validate example naming/output directives, but does not establish completeness or accuracy of exported documentation; inspect those contracts directly.

## README and application docs

A useful README answers: what the project does, supported environments, a minimal install/run path, configuration, a small example, operational concerns, testing, and where to report issues. Keep commands copyable and verify them from a clean checkout. Explain defaults and failure modes; never put real secrets in snippets. For applications, document endpoints, auth, timeouts, data retention, migrations, health checks, metrics, and graceful shutdown.

Use [application](references/application.md) for command and service docs, [project docs](references/project-docs.md) for repository-level files, and the templates under [assets/templates](assets/templates/) only as editable starting points.

## Library and API documentation

Document the import path, supported Go versions, compatibility policy, main types, lifecycle, error contracts, and one complete example. Keep examples close to the package they demonstrate. If a package is private or contains customer/internal data, keep docs private; do not register it with public documentation services by default. Public publishing and Playground links require explicit approval, a license/privacy check, and confirmation that the code and dependencies are intended for disclosure.

See [library](references/library.md) and [code comments](references/code-comments.md) for API-specific checks.

## Release and maintenance docs

Changelogs should describe user-visible behavior, compatibility, migrations, security fixes, and known limitations. A contribution guide should explain prerequisites, formatting, tests, generated files, commit/PR expectations, and local checks. Keep `llms.txt` or machine-readable project summaries concise and generated from verified project facts.

When documenting release artifacts, derive the URL from the actual GoReleaser or release configuration and test it against a real release. Archive names often include project, version, OS, and architecture; do not hard-code a guessed filename. Prefer the release page or an exact generated asset URL when the naming template is configurable.

## Review checklist

1. Read code, tests, configuration, and release metadata before making a claim.
2. Mark experimental, platform-specific, and version-specific behavior.
3. Make examples compile and keep output stable.
4. Check links, code blocks, commands, and filenames from a clean checkout.
5. Run documentation tests and the relevant package tests.
6. Review secrets, personal data, private paths, and licensing before publication.
